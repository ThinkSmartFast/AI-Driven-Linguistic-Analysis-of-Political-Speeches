Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you very much. Wow. What a crowd this is. Look at this. These are incredible people. They're incredible people. Unbelievable. So many people outside would like to let them in. Would anybody like to give up their seat or their standing area? Well, a very special hello to Allentown, a great place.

And hello, Pennsylvania. I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are. [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump."] But I'd like to begin with a very, very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans with your vote this election.

Oh, do I look forward to this election? Do we? We, I'm going to say we because we're going to do it as a group. Look, Mr. Wall over here, he is the greatest guy. I want to buy one of those suits. We will end inflation. We will stop the invasion of criminals into our country, and we will bring back the American dream.

We're doing it together, Pennsylvania. Our country will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, the worst administration in the history of our country. Jimmy Carter is a happy man.

Jimmy Carter looks like a brilliant, brilliant president by comparison. But whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country, we're going to turn it around, and we're going to turn it around fast. I'm asking you to be excited about the future again. You have to be excited about the future.

They've taken all that excitement away from you. They've embarrassed us. They've embarrassed us. Kamala has embarrassed us. She doesn't have what it takes. [Audience boos] I'm asking you to dream big again. You're going to dream big, and this is going to be a very special time. It's going to be America's new golden age.

We're going to make it a golden age. It seems impossible, doesn't it? Doesn't it seem impossible with these stupid people that we've had to put up with over the last four years? We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We were energy independent four years ago. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands.

It's in your hands. If we win Pennsylvania, we are going to win the whole deal. Got to do it. Next Tuesday, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough. You're not going to take it anymore. "Kamala, you're fired. Get out. Get out of here. You're fired. You're fired. Get the hell out of here. You were a terrible VP, but you were an even worse border czar."

How about our border czar? [Audience boos] And Border Patrol last week endorsed me with the strongest endorsement they've ever given. And they said that she was unfit to run the borders. Can you imagine? I said, "How many times did she call you in four years?" Almost four years. They said, "She never called us once."
Donald Trump

Medium (1.617)
I said, "How about you?" "No, she never called any of us, sir. Never called us. She was the border czar, but she never called." She's incompetent. She's incompetent. We've set an all-time record in the early voting, by the way. So, if you have a mail-in ballot, get that damn ballot in, please, immediately because they've already started cheating in Lancaster.

They've cheated.[Audience boos] We caught them with 2,600 votes. Now, we caught them cold, 2,600 votes. Think of this. Think of this. And every vote was written by the same person. I wonder how that happened. Must be a coincidence. It must be a coincidence. And then, in York, I know York because I used to be a big weightlifter.

Then, after about three days, I decided to give it up. It wasn't for me. That's where they had all the weights, right? They had the weights. I built that room. I loved building it. I enjoyed it so much. Then we put the weights down and I said, "I don't like that. That's no fun." I like building the room.

I just didn't like lifting the weights. But New York, they had a great bodybuilder. This was the bodybuilding capital of the world, right? Isn't it? I wanted to be here as a contestant one day. I just didn't want to do the work. It's too much work. We had enough to do. But if not, get everyone you know to the polls on November 5th and you have to vote, vote, vote.

We got to vote. We got to get these people out of there. We got to vote fast. Today, they're busing people. They're in a place in Washington and they're busing. I got buses all up.

And the fake news doesn't report those stories. [Audience boos] That's a lot. No, that's a lot. Look at that. See, we must be coming. That is a lot of fake news. When they lose their final ounce of credibility, they'll probably turn good again because they're losing so much credibility. Do you know when I first started running, their approval rating when I -- very -- the very beginning, before maybe I even started, it was like 92 percent favorable rating.
Donald Trump

You know what it is now? Twelve percent. I drove it down like almost 90 points. I drove it down, numbers. I'm very proud of it. I've exposed them as being fake. But with your help, one week from today, we're going to defeat Kamala Harris and the media, and we're going to win back that beautiful, beautiful White House, and we're going to make America great again.

In less than four years, Kamala has shattered our middle class. You notice I don't mention Joe, crooked Joe. He's so crooked. It's hard to believe because they basically took the presidency away from me. They just walked up, said, "You're not running anymore." I don't use the word coup. It's too Frenchy-sounding for me, coup.

No, they just took it away. I like that better. They took it away. They walked in. They said -- no, he had a -- he had a rough debate. I would say it was rough.
