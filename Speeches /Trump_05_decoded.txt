Well, thank you very much. You know, he's been my friend for a long time. I didn't know he was such a good football player. That's a good player. That's a real team in the championship. See, you learn -- every day, you learn something about people.

You want to sit? You want to sit? It is -- it is -- wow. There's a -- this is a packed house here, Mr. President. And there's thousands more outside, too.
Donald Trump
00:00:50-00:01:07 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.715)
A lot of people. All along the highways, we're driving up, and there's a lot of love. We're going to have a big election. We're going to have a -- November 5th, and you'll probably -- many of you have -- who's already voted? Yeah. It's going to be a big one. I think it's the most important election in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:01:07-00:01:23 (15 sec)
No Signal (0.651)
I really believe that. I think most of the people here do, too. And we don't say that lightly, but it's -- it's a big one. We have -- we have some people that are not doing a good job. They're not doing a good job for our country. So, thank you all for being here. It's a great honor. Thank you.
Burt Jones
00:01:23-00:01:37 (14 sec)
No StressLens
Absolutely. Absolutely. It is a -- it is a huge honor to have you here in middle Georgia, Mr. President, and I know you have another -- a big event tonight in Duluth, Georgia. Obviously, Georgia is going to play a pivotal role.
Donald Trump
00:01:37-00:01:37 ( sec)

That's right.
Burt Jones
00:01:37-00:01:45 (8 sec)

I -- I was on an interview earlier this morning, and -- and they were asking me about the closing, the next 12 days.
Donald Trump
00:01:45-00:01:46 ( sec)
No StressLens
Right.
Burt Jones
00:01:46-00:01:57 (11 sec)
No StressLens
Next 12 to 13 days. And I told them that you -- while your opponent is doing programs like "The View" and Howard Stern to try to close out [Audience member calls out "Boo"] the event --
Donald Trump
00:01:57-00:01:59 (2 sec)

You -- you have chosen to close out the deal by going around the country and speaking to religious leaders --
Donald Trump
00:02:19-00:02:20 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Yeah.
Burt Jones
00:02:20-00:02:34 (14 sec)
No StressLens
Talking in places of worship like here in Zebulon, Georgia. And I -- and we have a saying here in -- in our state that people who show up for church on Sundays go to the polls on Tuesdays.
Donald Trump
00:02:34-00:02:34 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Yeah.
Burt Jones
00:02:34-00:02:47 (12 sec)
No StressLens
And -- and I think that's -- I think that's true all over. So, we -- talk about -- a little bit about the -- the event you had yesterday in Miami with the Latino pastors and -- and all of that.
Donald Trump
00:02:47-00:03:08 (21 sec)
Weak (1.429)
Well, I did. We had a tremendous thing at Doral and Miami, and it was a beautiful day. And we had pastors. We had a lot of Hispanics. And we're setting every record with Hispanics. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Great people, very industrious, hardworking, smart, beautiful people. And we've really -- I guess we're setting the record already.
Donald Trump
00:03:08-00:03:41 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.053)
It's going to be set. And we have actually something. A couple of polls just came out. We're at 56 percent. You know, normally, like, guys like Romney -- anybody like Romney? [Audience responds "No"] Guys like Romney were getting just a few points. And we're getting here, we are with the potential to actually win, which hasn't been done maybe forever, almost forever with the Republican Party, all along the border and all along in Texas and other places along the line where -- by the way, they're working very hard to keep some very bad people out of our country.
Donald Trump
00:03:41-00:04:02 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.064)
Some -- if you take a look at what they've done with our border, it's so bad. I think it's the biggest -- actually, just to skip over to it. I think it's the single biggest problem we have. We -- we talk about inflation, and it's horrible, and the economy. But if -- you take a look at inflation, and the biggest problem to me is the border where they allow murderers into our country.
Donald Trump
00:04:02-00:04:18 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.447)
They allow prisoners into our country. They empty out their prisons from all over the world. And to me, it's the biggest problem that we have. I think it's the No. 1 thing, and we're going to do something -- we're going to -- we're going to do something to stop it very quickly. We built hundreds of miles of wall.
Donald Trump
00:04:18-00:04:35 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.949)
We were doing great, and we had the greatest -- we had the most successful -- the day I left office -- you've seen that very famous chart. I love that chart. I love it. I love that chart. I love that chart. But -- oh, there it is.
Burt Jones
00:04:35-00:04:36 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Yes.
Donald Trump
00:04:36-00:04:37 (2 sec)
No StressLens
But if you -- if you take a look -- look at that.
Burt Jones
00:04:37-00:04:38 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Well, I [Inaudible]
Donald Trump
00:04:38-00:04:55 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.045)
That's pretty good. They do -- they do a very good job back there. They never know when I'm going to introduce it, but -- and usually, I don't. You know, usually, I don't introduce it. But I did that one day, and I turned to the right to look, and I -- I'm glad -- I'm glad I turned. Otherwise, I wouldn't be with you right now.
Donald Trump
00:04:55-00:05:14 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.308)
But -- but if you look at the arrow on the bottom, the arrow on the bottom, that was the day I left office, and that was the lowest day we've had in terms of illegals coming into our country. And that included drugs and human trafficking and usually mostly in women, by the way. And that was -- we had it really going.
Donald Trump
00:05:14-00:05:21 (7 sec)
No Signal (0.376)
And then you take a look at what happened right after I left. What they've done to our country is just not describable. [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump."]
Burt Jones
00:05:21-00:05:42 (21 sec)
No StressLens
Well, we're glad you're here, too. You made it through that, too, as well, Mr. President. And what we're going to do today -- and I want to -- before we start with our first question here in this town hall, I want to brag on you a little bit because, you know, the -- people only get to see you from afar, and there's very few of us that get to interact with you one on one.
Burt Jones
00:05:42-00:06:04 (22 sec)
No StressLens
I want to tell you, this is a great guy to be around. I mean, he's a guy's guy right here. And he -- and he also -- he also has a big heart. And I just want to tell you a quick story that the national news media never covered about him. But when we had the hurricanes that hit, we had Hurricane Helene that hit southeast Georgia a couple of weeks ago.
Burt Jones
00:06:04-00:06:24 (20 sec)
No StressLens
Number one, he was the first person on the ground in Valdosta, Georgia, right after those storms. And -- and after I got to -- after I got to go and look at some of the communities that were hit -- and they were hit hard. It was a generational change there -- I saw -- I said to myself, I've got to do something about this.
Burt Jones
00:06:24-00:06:49 (25 sec)
No StressLens
And I ended up calling a good friend, Georgia-native, of mine named Jason Aldean. You all know Jason. Jason was -- Jason was doing a concert in Macon, Georgia, and I said, "Jason, I know -- I know you're from Macon, and I'm glad I'm coming to your concert. How about us team up together and do a little hurricane relief fund for the victims of the hurricane?" And of course, Jason agreed wholeheartedly.
Burt Jones
00:06:49-00:07:13 (24 sec)
No StressLens
But then I called this man, and at -- at 7:30 in the morning, one ring, he picks up the phone. He goes, "Hello, Burt?" You know. And he doesn't ever waste any time. He's all business. He goes, "How are we doing in Georgia, Burt?" You know. I said, "We're doing great." I was like, look, we -- I told him about the storm, and he was very obviously aware of it.
Burt Jones
00:07:13-00:07:30 (17 sec)
No StressLens
And he's -- and I -- immediately, I said, "Look, Jason Aldean and I are going to do something this Saturday night. Would you like to be a part?" Without hesitation, he said, "Yes, absolutely." He said something to somebody in the background and said, "Hey, let's put together something for Burt Jones and Jason Aldean, and let's team up with them."
Burt Jones
00:07:30-00:07:38 (8 sec)
No StressLens
And I want to tell you something. They started a GoFundMe page on Tuesday. By Saturday of that same week, because of him, we had raised $7 million for the victims of the hurricane. [Applause] And --
Donald Trump
00:07:38-00:07:39 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Thank you.
Burt Jones
00:07:39-00:07:51 (12 sec)

And that was significant. I just want to thank you in front of this audience.
Donald Trump
00:07:51-00:08:07 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.361)
Oh, thank you. Jason is terrific, by the way. He was -- he's always the first to jump in, along with you. And you have a great lieutenant governor. And I have to tell you, we've also -- and we have -- and Burt and I have spoken about it. We also had a lot of help from your governor. He's been really great.
Donald Trump
00:08:07-00:08:29 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.226)
And so, we appreciate that. We've -- we've been -- we've been all working together. You know, Georgia got hit so hard, and it worked very well over here from the standpoint of people getting together and helping. FEMA has had a hard time. Nobody knows exactly why. But the federal government's response was -- I don't know if it was as bad here as it was in North Carolina.
Donald Trump
00:08:29-00:08:48 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.169)
I was in North Carolina yesterday, three different stops, and just -- I followed it in. I actually followed the hurricane in, and I went there. And it -- it is not even believable, but FEMA, meaning the White House, did not do their job. They did not do their job. And we got to change it. We had a great FEMA when we were doing it.
Donald Trump
00:08:48-00:08:58 (10 sec)
No Signal (0.49)
We had some problems, too. When we had, FEMA came in and they handled it, but they're not -- and they spent a lot of their money on other things. You know that. They spent a lot of their money --
Burt Jones
00:08:58-00:08:59 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Sure.
Donald Trump
00:08:59-00:09:21 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.377)
On the illegal migrants coming in, almost $1 billion. And there was no money. And so, now, they're going to have to have a special session in Congress to try and get money. And it's -- it's too bad. It's too bad. But you know who did help us, though? Elon Musk. He helped us because they needed Starlink.
Donald Trump
00:09:21-00:09:38 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.462)
I said, "What's Starlink?" They would tell me, "Sir, do you know Elon Musk?" I said, "Yeah, he endorsed me," right? I said, "Yeah. He's great." He's -- you see that rocket ship coming the other day? Who ever saw anything like that? Only Elon. I said, "Is that yours?" He said, "That's mine. That's the only one that can do it."
Donald Trump
00:09:38-00:09:54 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.074)
But anyway -- but he needed Starlink -- they needed Starlink badly in North Carolina, and I called him. I said, "Elon, they have a big problem." They had no communication. People were dying. He saved a lot of lives. And he had it over there so fast, it was amazing. They couldn't get it because it's hard to get.
Donald Trump
00:09:54-00:10:12 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.257)
And it was sort of interesting because I was on the phone with him and I said Starlink and we're talking a little bit and the person called me that needed it so badly in North Carolina during my call with Elon. I hadn't hung up. He said, "Thank you, sir, for getting us Starlink." I said, "How did you call them? How did you talk to them? We're still on the phone."
Donald Trump
00:10:12-00:10:17 (5 sec)
No Signal (0.425)
He said, "Well, I have ways of doing things." But he got -- he got that to them right away --

No StressLens
Right.
Donald Trump
00:10:18-00:10:23 (5 sec)
No Signal (0.947)
And it made a very big difference. Also, they got it into Georgia. So, I want to thank Elon for being really very gracious and smart.
Burt Jones
00:10:23-00:10:39 (16 sec)
No StressLens
Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you. Well, Mr. President, if it's all right with you, I know we've got some folks here that would love to get to ask you questions directly.

It is a -- it is something that we're -- we're glad to be here in the church, and we do thank Pastor Billy Smith. I tell folks all the time that we're -- you know, we're not complicated here in Georgia. We -- we love our God, we love our country, and we love college football, you know, right? And we know prayers can be answered because the good Lord gave us Kirby Smart at the University of Georgia.

Just recently, a study came out from Arizona Christian University showing that 32 million Christian Americans will not be going to the polls to vote this year. If you could share a final message to those Christians to encourage them to go to the polls, what would your message be?
Donald Trump
00:12:06-00:12:25 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.203)
Well, you know, it's interesting, Matthew, that if you look over the last 30 years or so, for whatever reason, Christians are not tremendous voters in terms of percentage. If they were, we'd never lose an election. We wouldn't have had these people in office. We would never lose an election. And I think they're -- I think they are.
Donald Trump
00:12:25-00:12:42 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.306)
I think we've really energized a lot of people this time because they've seen how bad it is. This last four years has been -- it's been a horror show, an absolute horror show. And I think -- I think we're going to see those numbers go way up. I'm -- I'm almost sure of it. And I'm even hearing that from -- statistically because you see what's coming in.
Donald Trump
00:12:42-00:13:05 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.669)
And by the way, record numbers of votes are coming in. So, that's supposed to be a good thing for us. And we have to make sure too big to rig. We want to make it too big to rig, right? But -- but if they did -- if they did, we would literally never lose an election. And, you know, there's persecution going on and especially, I don't know if you've heard, with Catholics.
Donald Trump
00:13:05-00:13:26 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.159)
I don't know what's going on with Catholics. Why are they after Catholics? But the Catholics are being persecuted. And school boards are being persecuted, parents. This group is not a nice group of people. You know, you think they're stupid, and they are really pretty dumb but -- when you look at what the policies, what they've done to this country, but they're vicious people.
Donald Trump
00:13:26-00:13:44 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.441)
They're vicious, vicious people. And people are being persecuted, people of religion. And you saw it a little bit during COVID where you'd have a service outside, everybody is five yards away and everything, and they're coming and arresting people. It's -- it's very bad. But I think you're going to see a big change.
Donald Trump
00:13:44-00:14:02 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.643)
I think you're going to see it now. And hopefully, we're going to keep it going. You know, without religion -- it's like -- it's like -- it's like the glue that holds it all together -- this would be a different country. The -- the religion and all of it -- virtually all of them are going -- if you look at that path, it wasn't helped by COVID.
Donald Trump
00:14:02-00:14:18 (15 sec)
No Signal (0.55)
By the way, when you had COVID, all of a sudden, people started thinking a little bit differently and they, you know, got used to a different way of life for a long period of time. And maybe it didn't quite come back. But it's going this way. If we ever had it going up, it would -- and I think we're going to get it up.
Donald Trump
00:14:18-00:14:36 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.294)
I really believe it. I think this election is important for even that reason, for everything. It's so important. But it's such a good question. You know who else are hard voters? Our NRA people, rifles and guns -- people that own guns. They vote in a very small proportion. If they ever voted, you could never lose.
Donald Trump
00:14:36-00:14:51 (15 sec)
No Signal (0.528)
And in fact, the Democrats, the radical left, used to fear them. And now, they don't feel them -- fear them any longer because they don't vote to the extent that they should. And, you know, look, we're -- we're Second Amendment. I think everyone in this room is Second Amendment and Second Amendment people. All right?

We -- as you know, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. We even built the embassy by moving the embassy. That became somewhat automatic.
