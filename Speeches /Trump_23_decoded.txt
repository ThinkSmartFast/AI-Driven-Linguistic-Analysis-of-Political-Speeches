Weak (1.365)
Whoa, whoa. This is a lot of people. This is a lot of people. What's going on with Virginia? What's going on? We're going to win Virginia. You know that. We got to get out and vote. And outside, you have exactly five times the number of people, so you're going to win this. We are going to win this on Tuesday.
Donald Trump
00:00:26-00:01:01 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.882)
Thank you, Mr. Governor. We're going to win. Thank you very much. You have a great governor in this state. He did a great job -- and your attorney general, the whole group. Thank you, Glenn. What a job. So, a very special hello to Virginia. I know it well, to put it mildly. And I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots.
Donald Trump
00:01:01-00:01:24 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.012)
That's what you are. You're patriots. And I'd like to begin with a very simple question for you to answer, if you don't mind. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] I've come today with a message of hope for all Americans with your vote on Tuesday. That's a big day.
Donald Trump
00:01:24-00:01:48 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.653)
You've got to get out. We win -- I'll tell you what. We win Virginia, we win the whole thing without question. The whole thing. [Applause] Now, it's very possible that without winning Virginia, we're going to win the whole thing, too, but it would be -- wouldn't it be cool? Wouldn't it be nice? We got to do it.
Donald Trump
00:01:48-00:02:22 (35 sec)
Weak (1.108)
We're going to win Virginia. I really believe it. We felt it. Your governor felt it. I felt it for a long time. But I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals into our country. And I will bring back the American dream. [Applause] This is all you really need to know: Kamala, a low-IQ person, broke it, and I will fix it.
Donald Trump
00:02:22-00:02:49 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.074)
I promise I will fix it. Go quickly. It's going to go quickly. They've done a lot of damage, but it'll go quickly. America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. And this election is a choice between whether you will have four more years of incompetence and failure or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:02:49-00:03:16 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.191)
That's what's going to happen. And I'm asking you to be excited about the future again. Be excited. You know, it's hard for you to be excited. We've -- you watch what they've done to this country, it's hard. Just be excited. It's coming back, and it's going to come back for you. And I'm asking you, remember this: to dream big again.
Donald Trump
00:03:16-00:03:46 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.887)
You're going to dream big, and we're going to do some incredible things because this will be America's new golden age. It's going to be a golden age of America. We're going to get the stupid people out of here as quickly as possible. What they've done -- every problem facing us can be solved. But now, the fate of our nation is in your hands.
Donald Trump
00:03:46-00:04:15 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.716)
It really is. It's in your hands. On Tuesday, you have to stand up. You have to tell Kamala. [Audience boos] And you can't call her Harris. You know why? Because nobody knows. I mean, you say Harris, "Who the hell is Harris?" The whole thing doesn't work, so we'll just call her Kamala. You're going to tell her that you've had it.
Donald Trump
00:04:15-00:04:50 (34 sec)
No Signal (0.882)
You've had it. Kamala, you're the worst vice president in history. You're terrible at what you do. You've destroyed our country. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. [Applause] Get the hell out of here. I'm here today in this incredible commonwealth for one very simple reason; because I believe we can win Virginia, and that would be unbelievable.
Donald Trump
00:04:50-00:05:08 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.546)
And working with your governor, we will get MS-13 the hell out of your communities. You're loaded up with them. We're loaded up. They don't want to touch them. We're going to touch them. Going to get them out. We're going to have ICE all over the place. You know what ICE is? You know what ICE is? They're very tough people that love our country.
Donald Trump
00:05:08-00:05:37 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.365)
And if you don't have very tough people, you're not getting MS-13 out anytime soon. No, ICE doesn't mind. ICE is like -- MS-13 is their cup of tea. We will cut your taxes, create millions of jobs, fix your schools, stop the indoctrination of your children, and we will not let them try to change your kids' gender.
Donald Trump
00:05:37-00:06:01 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.272)
No, you will not be doing that. We won't be changing your children's gender with their transgender craziness. [Applause] And we will protect parents' rights, and we will protect school choice. You're going to have school choice here. School choice. And we'll bring back an education system based on merit.
Donald Trump
00:06:01-00:06:30 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.143)
Don't forget, our Supreme Court gave us a very great ruling, a decision that we're actually allowed to use merit again -- merit -- so that if somebody works hard -- if somebody works hard, they do well. They work so hard and do so well. We actually have a merit-based country again. Can you believe it? Isn't that nice? And we will, of course, keep men out of women's sports.
Donald Trump
00:06:30-00:07:04 (34 sec)
No Signal (0.652)
I promise. Last year, the radical left's gender insanity arrived right here in Salem when a man was allowed to transfer onto the Roanoke College women's swim team. [Audience boos] And I just met them backstage. They're great swimmers. I didn't notice a male on that particular team. I didn't notice a male on that team.
Donald Trump
00:07:04-00:07:31 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.373)
Perhaps I don't understand what's happening, but I didn't see any males on that team. Believe me. But the brave members of the swim team stood up to the transgender fanatics -- something new in our country. And those strong -- and I would say beautiful, but I'm not allowed to use that term anymore with women because, if you say beautiful, it means the end of your career in politics.
Donald Trump
00:07:31-00:07:48 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.255)
You're not allowed to say a woman's beautiful. So, I will not tell you how beautiful they are, but they are beautiful. But those strong, beautiful, intelligent women, they won. They won. And today, we're joined by seven of the great members -- really championship incredible swimmers -- of the Roanoke College women's swim team that have gotten a little publicity.
Donald Trump
00:07:48-00:07:54 (6 sec)
Weak (1.244)
They've gotten more publicity than I have. What the hell is going on here? Including Team Captain Lily Mullens, a real champion. Come on up. Come on up, ladies. [Applause] [Off-mic] Lily, everybody. [Applause]
Lily Mullens
00:07:54-00:08:49 (55 sec)
No StressLens
Thank you. Oh, sorry. Thank you so much, President Trump. As female athletes, especially, we know that men have an inherent advantage over women in sports. And due to current policies, though, men are competing against women of all ages in all sports. [Audience boos] Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have advocated for -- they've advocated for and pushed for this anti-woman, sex-based discrimination to continue all over this country. [Audience boos]
Lily Mullens
00:08:49-00:09:05 (15 sec)
No StressLens
And point blank, it's unfair. So, I would like to thank you, President Trump, for standing with women and promising to protect the rights of all of us. [Applause] And I -- we are -- we are so lucky to have a leader like Donald Trump with common sense, who knows what a strong woman is, and will fight for generations of girls to come.
Lily Mullens
00:09:05-00:09:21 (17 sec)
No StressLens
Thank you so much, and God bless America. [Applause] What a good job. Thank you, Lily. How about if we introduce each member of the team? Lily, can we do that? Come on up here. Just say your name and -- come on up, Lily. You handle it. All right. So, I'm Lily Mullens. You want to go?

What the hell is going wrong with our country? Can you imagine? And the men don't realize they're tougher and smarter than us. I hate to say it, but they're tough. The men -- all right, that's a great job. Good job you did, Lily. Beautiful. Thank you very much, girls. Go win that championship now, please. [Applause]

So, we're just three days away from the greatest political victory in the history of this country, probably in the history of the world. But we have to get you guys out. You got to get out. We have to get out. We want to win everything. We want to win the popular vote. We want to win everything. And, you know, it's always tough when you have California.
Donald Trump
00:11:06-00:11:25 (19 sec)
Weak (1.192)
They send out like 38 million ballots. They don't know where they go. Well, they actually do sort of know where they go. But they don't know where they go. They don't know where they're coming from. They come pouring back in the millions, and then they lose a -- a Republican always loses from 5 to 7 million.
Donald Trump
00:11:25-00:11:44 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.132)
You know, I was in California. You know, we took a poll just recently. Not us -- it just came out like today -- did you see it -- that I'm winning with Hispanics over the Democrat by eight points. And I'm telling you, if God came down and agreed to be our vote-taker for one day, just one day -- God would only need one second, actually.
Donald Trump
00:11:44-00:12:01 (17 sec)
Weak (1.001)
If He came down and he was going to be our vote-taker -- meaning, if we had an honest election in California, we would win California. But when you have New York, Illinois, and California that like automatically -- it's like ridiculous -- automatically goes to a Democrat, it's tough to win the popular vote because they're three big states and it's like automatic.
Donald Trump
00:12:01-00:12:13 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.697)
Nobody is supposed to question them. You have Gavin Newscum, who's a governor of California -- [Audience boos] And he just signed a bill. And in signing the bill, you know what it says? If you're an official, if you're anybody, you are not allowed, under any circumstances, to ask whether or not somebody has voter ID.
Donald Trump
00:12:13-00:12:37 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.301)
If you say, "Let me see your voter ID," you are criminally liable. They will give you the electric chair. [Audience boos] "Ma'am, may I please see your voter ID?" How dare you ask me for voter ID. How crazy is this place? But you have a very sane, very solid governor. There's something very nice -- I can imagine.
Donald Trump
00:12:37-00:13:01 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.08)
Glenn's like me. I think when we heard that -- when -- we said, "This is getting a little bit crazier." So, now, it's not only that you don't have to have voter ID. Now, you're not even allowed to ask for it under penalty of a lot of problems. It's crazy. We've got to straighten that whole mess out. And then they say, he lost the -- "He lost the popular vote."
Donald Trump
00:13:01-00:13:16 (15 sec)
No Signal (0.466)
But, you know, it's tough. But I have a feeling. I mean, the polls are showing we're going to win everything. We're going to win the popular vote. We're going to win everything. [Applause] And I'd love to win the popular vote with them cheating. You know, let them cheat because that's what they do. They do it very well.
Donald Trump
00:13:16-00:13:36 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.167)
They're very professional, but I think we have a really good chance to win the popular vote. And I think things are going to be very interesting. It's going to be one of the most interesting days in the history of our country, and it's going to be the most important election in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:13:36-00:14:15 (39 sec)

And if we win -- which we should because we got a big lead. This is like Lily. She's swimming and swimming, and she's 10 yards advanced with about five yards to go. That's where we are. In other words, we're going to win. But I have put everything on the line for you. I guess -- I guess I don't want to say this too much, but, I guess you know, that little incident.
Donald Trump
00:14:15-00:14:47 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.04)
Somebody said, "Even his life, he put on the line." I don't know. But I know one thing. I wouldn't have changed it for anything. I wouldn't have changed it for anything because we're going to make our country great again. We're going to make -- we have such potential. We're going to make our country great again.
Donald Trump
00:14:47-00:15:22 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.217)
And I only want one thing from you. I don't want your money. We don't need your money. You keep that money. I only want a little thing called your vote, and that's what -- we'd be great. So, we want your vote, and it would be a great tribute to Glenn and to me and to your great lieutenant governor who endorsed me recently.
Donald Trump
00:15:22-00:16:01 (39 sec)
No StressLens
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. With your help, we're going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we're going to indeed make America great again. So, yesterday was a big day. I can't believe this happened. I can't believe it happened. You know, I don't think anybody can believe.
Donald Trump
00:16:01-00:16:35 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.351)
I've never seen numbers like this in my life because it was announced that Kamala's economy is like in a depression. The worst numbers I've ever seen. The worst numbers in many, many, many years. Kamala's economy added only 12,000 jobs. I've never heard of that before. Just by normal growth, you add 100 or 150.
Donald Trump
00:16:35-00:16:59 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.697)
And for years, we've been looking -- for many years, for decades, 200-, 250,000. So, yesterday, it was announced that they added only 12,000. It's the lowest number in many years, but that's the good part. That's the good part for them because we lost nearly 30,000 private sector jobs, along with nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs in one month.
Donald Trump
00:16:59-00:17:29 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.259)
This is not recession stuff. This is depression. I hate to tell you that. Under Kamala's catastrophic agenda and Crooked Joe -- but I don't even know. Is he still around? What the hell? You know, in all fairness to him, you might have noticed, I'm not a big fan. But he was running. I spent $150 million trying to defeat this guy.
Donald Trump
00:17:29-00:18:03 (34 sec)
No Signal (0.251)
We spent -- think of it. And we were doing well. We had the debate. He didn't do great, but he did fine. We had the debate, and his numbers weren't great. And they walked into him, and they said, "We want you out." He said, "I'm not going to get out. I got 14 million votes. You didn't get anything." "We want you out, Joe. You're going out."
Donald Trump
00:18:03-00:18:30 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.433)
Think of what -- no. But think of the consequences of this. This is a guy who's the president. He won it in the primaries, whether you think he's great or horrible. It doesn't matter. He won it in the primaries, right? You know, they would look at me if that -- if we ever did that, they would say, "This is a threat to democracy."
Donald Trump
00:18:30-00:18:54 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.125)
Right? Everything I do, he's a threat to democracy. If I walk two feet over in the wrong -- he's a threat to -- these people are sick. Can you imagine if I walked into somebody, a president's office, said we want you out? But, you know, Crazy Nancy -- she's crazy as a bedbug. And I don't know. I think the attorney general -- maybe you could look at it.
Donald Trump
00:18:54-00:19:20 (26 sec)
Weak (1.325)
You have a great attorney general. By the way, we just won a big -- we just want a big case to Mr. Attorney General. We just want a big case because our Republicans have to activate a little bit. So, did you know that Nancy Pelosi was a big investor in Visa? OK. A big -- hey, she started off with nothing, and now, she's worth $200 million.
Donald Trump
00:19:20-00:19:39 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.402)
Other than that, I think she's been quite honest. [Audience member calls out "She's not corrupt"] Her average pay was about $139,000 over those years. And now, she's worth 200 million, but she's quite an honest woman. But did you -- Mr. Attorney General, I think this is most important for you. I don't know.
Donald Trump
00:19:39-00:19:57 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.425)
Maybe you can -- maybe you can look at it. You know, you touched that little Washington area a little bit, so maybe you can look at it. So, she's a big investor in Visa, right? Big. I mean, you know, she's got plenty of money, plenty of cash, and not a good woman. A bad woman. Bad woman -- I think she hates our country actually.
Donald Trump
00:19:57-00:20:25 (28 sec)
No StressLens
When she impeached me knowing that I did nothing wrong, I said, "That's a bad woman." Bad -- but she had Visa stock. She had Visa, big position of Visa, Mr. Attorney General. And guess what happened. She sold her whole stake. And then the following morning, the department of injustice announced that we're doing a major investigation of Visa and the stock.
Donald Trump
00:20:25-00:20:46 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.211)
So, I don't know. Maybe it's coincidence, Mr. Attorney General. But think of it. She has -- she has Visa stock. She sells. And the following month, sold all of it. She had it for years, and the following morning, they announce a major, major investigation into Visa. You know what happened to that stock? It wasn't a pretty thing.
Donald Trump
00:20:46-00:21:10 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.536)
So, we'll check that out. I think -- I hope that he checks that out. Because, you know, what, she's a crook. And she's been doing that for years. She's been doing that crap for years. You ought to look at her. Under Kamala's catastrophic agenda, more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs -- this was just announced yesterday.
Donald Trump
00:21:10-00:21:32 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.4)
They've been wiped out since just the start of the year. These are prime jobs. These are manufacturing jobs. These are the -- the best jobs. A hundred and fifty thousand Americans joined the unemployment rolls. Can you imagine? This stuff is just all coming out. Remember, 818,000 jobs, two months, ago were fake.
Donald Trump
00:21:32-00:21:55 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.785)
They put them in. It was going to be through the election. They put in 818,000 fake jobs, and they were going to announce and revise -- biggest number ever. They were going to revise the numbers right after the election. These are crooks, OK? And fortunately, there was a whistleblower that couldn't stand it.
Donald Trump
00:21:55-00:22:22 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.009)
And he blew the whistle, and we learned. And now, yesterday with these numbers, we learned a revision down also of an extra 112,000 jobs. These are big numbers. You know, normally, it's like 2,000 jobs, 4,000 jobs. It's almost a million jobs that were fake. These are fake jobs. That's why they call them Crooked Joe, I guess, right? Crooked Joe Biden.
Donald Trump
00:22:22-00:22:39 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.795)
And so, all of these jobs and all of it was going to be announced right after the election. Could you imagine? You run in the election, you lose, and then they announce that they just screwed you for a million jobs in order to look better. And this is what we're dealing with in our country. This is what we're dealing with.

No Signal (0.503)
Eight hundred and eighteen thousand plus 112 -- nearly a quarter of a million people dropped out of the labor force this month. How about that? That's like a depression. I never wanted to be Herbert Hoover, honestly. They say, "Who's your favorite president?" I give them names. And I do like Ronald Reagan, right? I liked him.
Donald Trump
00:23:04-00:23:21 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.054)
But they say, "Who's your favorite president?" I tell you, he could have been a little tougher on trade. Frankly, I would have liked him even better if he was tougher because we are tough. You know, China paid us hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs. No other president got 10 cents from China.
Donald Trump
00:23:21-00:23:40 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.077)
Hundreds of -- hundreds of billions of dollars. [Applause] But I always said I don't want to be Herbert Hoover. I refuse to be Herbert Hoover. That was a bad one. He was the president, and we had the Great Depression. You could end up with a Great Depression right now, the way that's going. Nobody can believe the numbers.

Nobody -- everyone was shocked. I was shocked. I heard it, and I said, "Oh, let me..." You know, TiVo, one of the greatest inventions in history, right, TiVo or its equivalent.

You know, you just play it back. I said, "Oh, I must have misunderstood it. Twelve thousand and we lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. We cannot take four more years of these incompetent people running our country. And a statistic that's really terrible is 100 percent of all net job gains in the past year -- in other words, all of the gains, you know, where it went? To migrants, 100 percent of the gains. [Inaudible]
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.739)
[Audience boos] And the other stat that you have to see -- and if you are an African American, you're not going to be happy with these numbers. But African American jobs have been decimated by the people that are coming into our country illegally. And they refuse to give the numbers, the fake news. Look at all of that fake news.
Donald Trump
00:24:47-00:25:16 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.486)
That's a lot. That's a lot. [Audience boos] They must have heard that your governor is going to be here. He has done a job. He's not going to take it easily because, think of it, the numbers are so bad. They came in, and they come in illegally. And many are murderers, drug dealers, and criminals of all kinds.

No Signal (0.843)
You know, the crime rate in Venezuela and other places where they come -- they come from all over the world. But the crime rates in many of these countries, all of the countries, is way down because they are giving us their criminals. They're bringing them into our country. But for African Americans, the job numbers are horrific, and they're not going to be announced until right after the election.

Kamala destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of defund the police movement.

We're going to prevent it. And we've never been so close to World War III. We have never ever been so close to -- with the Middle East all over the place.
