So, let me say, on behalf of myself and the first second gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff -- [applause] -- thank you for the warm welcome. [Applause]

No Signal (0.357)
And let me just say, it's good to be here with all of the friends, all of the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell -- [applause]; Senator Bob Casey, who we will reelect this November -- [applause]; Senator John Fetterman -- [applause]; Mayor Cherelle Parker -- [applause]; and Chairman Jaime Harrison.

No StressLens
And it is so good to be here with your incredible governor, Josh Shapiro. [Applause] And I will say Josh is a dear, dear friend and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years. And I told Josh, "Look, I am so, so invested in our friendship, in doing this together." Because together, with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania. [Applause] We will win Pennsylvania.
Kamala Harris
00:03:03-00:03:04 (1 sec)
No StressLens
And I thank you, Josh. I thank you. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:03:04-00:03:44 (40 sec)
No StressLens
So -- so, Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the president of the United States a mere two weeks ago. [Applause] And it's -- it's been a bit of a whirlwind. [Laughter]
Kamala Harris
00:03:44-00:04:26 (42 sec)
No StressLens
And just last night, the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting, and so -- [applause] -- I stand -- I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:04:26-00:04:33 (7 sec)
No Signal (0.785)
And so, now we got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:04:33-00:04:44 (10 sec)
No Signal (0.309)
And to all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum, and I know exactly what we are up against. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:04:44-00:05:11 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.119)
Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, elected district attorney. [Applause] And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:05:11-00:05:20 (9 sec)
No Signal (0.481)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds -- [applause]: predators who abused women -- [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:05:20-00:05:26 (6 sec)
No StressLens
-- fraudsters who scammed consumers -- [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:05:26-00:05:28 (2 sec)
No StressLens
-- cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:05:28-00:05:35 (7 sec)
No StressLens
So, hear me when I say -- [applause] -- I know Donald Trump's type. [Applause; Audience chants "Lock him up"]
Kamala Harris
00:05:35-00:05:38 (3 sec)
No StressLens
So -- but let -- [Audience chants "Lock him up"]
Kamala Harris
00:05:38-00:05:40 (2 sec)

Let me -- let me just say. [Audience chants "Lock him up"]
Kamala Harris
00:05:40-00:05:44 (4 sec)

Let me say. Hold on. [Audience chants "Lock him up"]
Kamala Harris
00:05:44-00:05:45 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Hold on, hold on.
Kamala Harris
00:05:45-00:06:31 (45 sec)
No StressLens
This campaign, our campaign is not just a fight against Donald Trump. [Applause] Our campaign, this campaign is a fight for the future. [Applause] It's a fight for the future.
Kamala Harris
00:06:31-00:07:06 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.414)
And, Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid leave. [Applause] We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:07:06-00:07:26 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.208)
We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for American families -- [applause] -- so that they have the chance not just to get by but to get ahead. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:07:26-00:08:42 (76 sec)
No StressLens
We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms: the freedom to vote -- [applause]; the freedom to be safe from gun violence -- [applause]; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- [applause]; and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body not having her government tell her what to do. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:08:42-00:08:43 ( sec)
No StressLens
So -- [Audience members call out, inaudibly]
Kamala Harris
00:08:43-00:08:44 (1 sec)
No StressLens
I love you too.
Kamala Harris
00:08:44-00:09:43 (59 sec)
No StressLens
So, here's the thing. Here's the thing. Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future -- [applause] -- a leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward; a fighter for the middle class; a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America -- [applause] -- a promise -- a promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some but for all. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:09:43-00:10:16 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.112)
So, Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader: Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:10:16-00:11:10 (54 sec)
No StressLens
So, to those who know him best -- to those who know him best, Tim is -- is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. [Applause] To the people -- to the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was Congressman. [Applause] To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. [Applause] And to his former high school football players, he was Coach -- [applause] -- Coach -- Coach.
Kamala Harris
00:11:10-00:12:04 (53 sec)
No StressLens
And in 91 days -- [applause] -- the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States. [Applause; Audience chants "Tim"]
Kamala Harris
00:12:04-00:12:31 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.319)
So, America, for some folks, they're just getting to know Coach Walz's story. And I'll tell you, he is the proud product of a middle-class family in rural Nebraska. [Applause] He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades -- [applause] -- as a member of the Army National Guard, and he went to college on the G.I. Bill. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:12:31-00:13:01 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.336)
He is someone who, long before he entered politics, worked as a teacher. [Applause] When Coach Walz and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school. [Applause] Coach Walz taught social studies; Gwen taught English. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:13:01-00:13:32 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.302)
After school, Tim was the linebackers coach for the football team -- [applause] -- where I've heard the stories about he had a knack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn't even see it in themselves. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:13:32-00:14:29 (57 sec)
No StressLens
Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything. And, together, they defied the odds -- hear this out -- going from a winless record to the school's first-ever state championship. [Applause; Laughs] Coach. Coach. A- -- [Audience members call out, inaudibly]
Kamala Harris
00:14:29-00:15:02 (32 sec)
Weak (1.042)
And I'll say and I'll add, Tim wasn't only a role model on the football field. Around that same time, Coach Walz was approached by a student in his social studies class. The young man was one of the first openly gay students at the school and was hoping to start a gay-straight alliance. At a time -- [applause] -- at a time when acceptance was difficult to find for LGBTQ students, Tim knew the signal that it would send to have a football coach get involved. [Applause] Right?
Kamala Harris
00:15:02-00:16:01 (60 sec)
No StressLens
So, he signed up to be the group's faculty advisor. [Applause] And as students have said, he made the school a safe place for everybody. [Applause] In the high school yearbook, the students voted Coach Walz the, quote, "most inspiring faculty member." [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:16:01-00:17:00 (58 sec)
No StressLens
And as I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having -- [applause] -- and that every kid deserves; the kind of coach, because he's the kind of person who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that's the kind of vice president he will be. [Applause] And that's the kind of vice president America deserves. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:17:00-00:17:12 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.148)
So, it was Coach Walz's students who actually helped him decide to run for office, and he served 12 years in Congress, representing a purple district, as he reached across the aisle to get things done.
Kamala Harris
00:17:12-00:17:54 (42 sec)
No StressLens
He was the highest-ranking -- [applause] -- he was the highest-ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the United States Congress -- [applause] -- and the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee. [Applause] And he was known as one of Capitol Hill's best marksmen -- [laughter] -- winning a bipartisan sharpshooting contest year after year. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:17:54-00:18:26 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.169)
In Washington, Tim worked to raise the minimum wage -- [applause]; to protect the freedom of workers to join a union -- [applause]; and he cast one of the critical votes to pass the Affordable Care Act -- [applause] -- which, of course, gave health insurance to tens of millions of Americans.
Kamala Harris
00:18:26-00:18:29 (4 sec)
No Signal (0.284)
And I'm going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger. [Applause; Audience chants "When we win"]
Kamala Harris
00:18:29-00:18:37 (8 sec)
No StressLens
We will win. That's right.
Kamala Harris
00:18:37-00:19:00 (22 sec)
No StressLens
Now let's talk about what we're dealing with on the other side. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:19:00-00:19:10 (11 sec)
No Signal (0.451)
So, on that last topic, if Donald Trump gets the chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act -- [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:19:10-00:19:30 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.612)
-- and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.
Kamala Harris
00:19:30-00:19:53 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.314)
Well, Governor Walz and I will not let that happen -- [applause] -- because we believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:19:53-00:20:41 (48 sec)
No StressLens
As governor, Tim has continued to fight for working families. He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota. [Applause] And he refused -- he refused, as governor, to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry -- [applause] -- so he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:20:41-00:21:11 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.095)
And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things, including when our middle class is strong, America is strong. [Applause] And strengthening the middle class will be my defining goal as I am president of the United States. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:21:11-00:21:27 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.045)
So, Pennsylvania, ours is a fight for the future of the middle class and it is a fight for freedom. [Applause] In this moment, we are witnessing a full-on attack against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:21:27-00:21:38 (11 sec)
No Signal (0.021)
Take reproductive freedom. Now think about this: Donald Trump said he wants to punish women. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:21:38-00:21:51 (13 sec)
No Signal (0.22)
And as a result of his actions, today in America one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban -- one out of three. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:21:51-00:22:04 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.568)
Some of these bans go back to the 1800s, even before women had a right to vote. Think about that.
Kamala Harris
00:22:04-00:22:45 (41 sec)
No StressLens
Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms: We're not going back. [Applause; Audience responds "We're not going back"]
Kamala Harris
00:22:45-00:22:48 (3 sec)
No StressLens
We're not going back. We're not going back. [Audience responds "We're not going back"]
Kamala Harris
00:22:48-00:23:00 (13 sec)
No Signal (0.902)
And so, let me say about Tim Walz, he has shown up to stand against these attacks long before he stood on the stage with me. After Roe was overturned, he was the first governor in the country to sign a new law that enshrined reproductive freedom as a fundamental right. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:23:00-00:23:39 (38 sec)
No Signal (0.699)
And with Tim Walz by my side, when I am president of the United States and we win majorities in the United States Congress, we will pass a bill to restore reproductive freedom, and I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:23:39-00:24:00 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.434)
Tim Walz has also defended the sacred freedom to vote. As governor -- [applause] -- as governor, he signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years. [Applause] And with Governor Walz's help, when I am president, we are going to finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause] We're going to get it done.
Kamala Harris
00:24:00-00:24:26 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.162)
So, Tim is a hunter and a gun owner who believes, as the majority of gun owners do, that we need reasonable gun safety laws in America. [Applause] So, as governor, he expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:24:26-00:24:43 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.441)
And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks -- [applause] -- red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:24:43-00:25:17 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.414)
Through his work, Tim, he -- you know, the way I think about it, he really does shine a light on a brighter future that we can build together. In his state, he has been a model chief executive. And with his experience, I'm telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:25:17-00:25:26 (8 sec)
No Signal (0.907)
In fact -- in fact, when you compare his resume -- [laughter] -- shall we? -- to Trump's running mate, well -- well -- well, some might say it's like -- it's like a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad. [Applause; Laughs]
Kamala Harris
00:25:26-00:25:54 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.089)
So, Pennsylvania, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in? A country -- a country of freedom -- [applause] -- compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:25:54-00:26:24 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.305)
And here's the beauty of our democracy: We each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. [Applause] The power is with the people. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:26:24-00:26:40 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.78)
We love our country, and I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. [Applause] That -- that is how we preserve the promise of America.
Kamala Harris
00:26:40-00:27:13 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.282)
And after all, you know, the promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids -- one a daughter of Oakland, California -- [applause] -- who was raised by a working mother; the other a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm -- [applause] -- it's the promise of America, because only in America -- only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:27:13-00:27:16 (3 sec)
No StressLens
Only in America. Only in America. Only in America. [Audience chants "USA"]
Kamala Harris
00:27:16-00:27:16 (1 sec)
No StressLens
That's right. [Audience chants "USA"]
Kamala Harris
00:27:16-00:27:18 (1 sec)
No StressLens
That's right. That's right.
Kamala Harris
00:27:18-00:27:48 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.335)
And so, Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of our great country, but our values are the same. And we both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:27:48-00:28:08 (20 sec)
No StressLens
He and I, we both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them. [Applause] When we look at folks, we see, in our fellow Americans, neighbors, not enemies -- [applause] -- not enemies.
Kamala Harris
00:28:08-00:28:35 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.23)
And so, my promise to you is this. Our campaign will reach out to everyone, from red states to blue states -- [applause] -- from the heartland to the coasts; in rural, urban, suburban, and Tribal communities. [Applause] We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. [Applause] And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:28:35-00:28:44 (8 sec)
No Signal (0.284)
And so, with Tim Walz by my side and with all of you at our side -- [applause] -- let us fight for the promise of our future. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:28:44-00:29:24 (40 sec)
No StressLens
And with that, I ask: Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard? [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:29:24-00:29:26 (2 sec)
No StressLens
Do we believe in freedom? [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:29:26-00:29:26 ( sec)

Do we believe in opportunity? [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:29:26-00:29:29 (3 sec)

Do we believe in the promise of America? [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:29:29-00:29:31 (1 sec)
No StressLens
And are we ready to fight for it? [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:29:31-00:29:37 (6 sec)
No StressLens
And when we fight -- [Audience responds "We win"]
Kamala Harris
00:29:37-00:29:38 (1 sec)

-- we win. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:29:38-00:29:43 (5 sec)

And now welcome the next vice president of the United States, Tim Walz. [Applause]
Tim Walz

Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you put in me but, maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy. [Applause] I'm thrilled to be on this journey with you and Doug -- this incredible journey.

No Signal (0)
And, Pennsylvania, I know you know this, but, my God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro. [Applause] Holy hell, can this guy bring the fire. He can bring the fire. This is a visionary leader. Also, I have to tell you, everybody in America knows, when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:30:14-00:30:59 (45 sec)
No StressLens
And I think sometimes we forget and you see people a little one-dimensional, but seeing a guy who cares so deeply about his family, a man with compassion, vision -- and I'll have to tell you this; I know this from experience -- there is no one you would rather go to a Springsteen concert in Jersey with than him -- [laughter] -- than that guy. [Applause; Audience calls out "Bruce"]

And I can't wait for all of you and America to get to know my incredible wife, Gwen, a 29-year public school educator -- [applause] -- don't ever underestimate teachers -- [applause] -- and our two beautiful kids, Hope and Gus.
Tim Walz
00:31:10-00:32:42 (93 sec)

I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and to help Vice President Harris become what we all know is very, very good for us to think about: next president of the United States of America. [Applause]

No Signal (0)
From her first day as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, attorney general of the great state of California -- [applause] -- a United States senator, and vice president of the United States -- [applause] -- Vice President Harris has fought on the side of the American people. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:33:20-00:34:20 (60 sec)
No StressLens
She took on the predators, she took on the fraudsters, she took down the transnational gangs, she stood up against powerful corporate interests, and she never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives. [Applause] And I want all of you to hold this and don't ever underestimate the power of this: She does it all with a sense of joy. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:34:20-00:35:08 (48 sec)
No StressLens
I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in West Point, Nebraska. I lived in Butte, a small town of 400, where community was a way of life. Growing up, I spent the summers working on the family farm. My mom and dad taught us: Show generosity towards your neighbors and work for a common good. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:35:08-00:35:57 (48 sec)
No StressLens
My dad served in the Army during the Korean War, and with his encouragement, at 17, I joined the Army National Guard. [Applause] For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation. [Applause] The National Guard gave me purpose, it gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves, and just as it did for my dad and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:35:57-00:36:51 (54 sec)
No StressLens
My dad was a teacher; my brothers and sisters and I followed in their footsteps. [Applause] Three out of four of us married teachers -- [applause] -- what we do. For nearly 20 years, I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies and coaching football -- [applause] -- including winning that state championship. [Laughs; Applause] Don't ever close the yearbook. Don't ever.
Tim Walz
00:36:51-00:38:15 (84 sec)
No StressLens
But it was my students -- they encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: a commitment of common good, a belief that one person can make a difference. So, in 2006 -- [applause] -- in 2006, I took a leap, and I ran for Congress.

Well, my neighbors graced me with an opportunity to represent them in the United States House of Representatives. [Applause] I'm proud of the work we did there together. I worked across the aisle on veterans issues, on agriculture, and on ways to grow rural economies. I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values. [Applause]

And now as governor the great state of Minnesota, I bring those experiences to bear in tackling the challenges that are facing our great state. Minnesota's strengths comes from our values, our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to always being willing to lend a helping hand. Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state capitol, and now Vice President Harris and I are running to take those very values to the White House. [Applause]

First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service. [Applause] He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself. [Applause] Again and again and again, Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand. [Applause] He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division, and that's to say nothing of his record as president. [Applause]

Look, that includes IVF, and this gets personal for me and my family. [Applause] When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through infertility treatments, and I remember praying every night for a call for good news, the pit in my stomach when the phone rang, and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn't worked. So, it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope. [Applause]

Vice President Harris's idea of freedom is a ticket for education to be that ticket to the middle class, not crippling debt -- [applause]; air that's clean, water that's pure, communities that are safe -- [applause]; a place where we settle our political differences not through violence but with our votes. [Applause] And that's what this election is about: What direction will this country go in?
