Weak (1.144)
Wow. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you very much. Well, thank you very much, and a very big hello to Michigan, which we're leading, by the way, by a lot. [Applause] And I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are.

You know, last night, my opponent had one of these, and they bused in people. But, you know, they got Beyonce, and Beyonce -- you know, Beyonce. They got Beyonce. So, Beyonce went up, spoke for a couple of minutes, and then left. And the place went crazy. They booed the hell out of everybody. They thought she was going to perform.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.326)
Now, I would have no interest in that, but they said -- and what happened is my opponent got up and started speaking. They booed the hell out of her. It's crazy. So, they have to use people to get people to come, and then they send buses. We don't send buses. Everybody comes. We're just going to make America great again.
Donald Trump
00:01:18-00:01:43 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.368)
It's very simple. [Applause] I thought I'd tell you that little story because you'll never hear it from the fake news. They don't talk about it. [Audience boos] They wouldn't tell you stories like that. So, I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I think so. [Audience responds "No"]
Donald Trump
00:01:43-00:02:15 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.158)
I think so. I doubt it. I doubt it. I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote in this election, we will end inflation. And you know what? It's we, not me. We will stop the invasion of criminals into our country. And I will bring back the American dream for your children and for yourself.
Donald Trump
00:02:15-00:02:45 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.673)
This is all you need to know. Kamala broke it. I will fix it. It's going to be very, very interesting. We'll fix it. You know, I've been watching what's happening. You know, you do know she's doing really badly, right? She can't speak. There's something wrong with her. We went through four years of that.
Donald Trump
00:02:45-00:03:15 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.336)
We can't go through four more years of that. With your support on November 5th, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and much stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:03:15-00:03:35 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.008)
Pretty good. And just so you know, this is it because we're not going to be able to save it much -- this is it. We've gone as low as we're going to go. We have to be able to save it. Any longer, you're not going to be able to save it. It's going to be gone. And we're not going to let that happen to this country.
Donald Trump
00:03:35-00:04:00 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.326)
I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country. I'm asking you to dream big again for you and your family, your children. This is going to be America's new golden age. You watch. We're going to bring back -- we're going to bring back those car companies to Michigan. They're going to come into Detroit.
Donald Trump
00:04:00-00:04:18 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.308)
I've been hearing about promises for 40 years on Detroit. We're going to make the promise -- you're going to have those car companies come roaring back. Through intelligent uses of tariffs, taxes, and incentives, they're all coming back. They don't come back, they're not going to be selling any cars in this country, let me tell you right now.
Donald Trump
00:04:18-00:04:46 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.467)
And I just did -- I have to tell you, I just did something very big for Detroit and for Michigan, in particular, in particular. I killed the massive plants that were going to be built in Mexico. They're dead. They're all dead. [Applause] And they were going to drive out all your damn business. They were going to take every one of your -- they were building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico.
Donald Trump
00:04:46-00:05:08 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.59)
And do you know who owned them? China. And they were going to flood our country with cars from just across the border. And I killed them. You know why I killed them? Because I said, "We're not going to have it. I'm going to win, and I'm going to put tariffs on those cars, and those cars will never be able to pay the tariff because it would be too high."
Donald Trump
00:05:08-00:05:36 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.854)
And they gave up on the project. They're not going to build the project. How good is that? And I'm not even in office. How about that? But we will be soon. So, if I can do that out of office, think about what the hell I can do in office, right? And I'll tell you what, these are the biggest plants in the world.
Donald Trump
00:05:36-00:06:00 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.592)
One of them is the biggest plant in the world by far. I think there's more business than your whole state would do with the autos. It's one of those things. And what I did is I said, "There's no car coming in," because they were going to just flood the whole nation. It would affect other states, too, but I think of Michigan and I think of Detroit, it was going to end it.
Donald Trump
00:06:00-00:06:39 (39 sec)
Weak (1.045)
You've already lost 70 percent probably from the heyday. It's dead. And we're going to now build it up. You're going to be bigger and better with the industry than you've ever been even in your heyday. [Applause] I got a lot of friends here. I know half the people here. Your future senator, I hope. Mike, you got to win this thing.
Donald Trump
00:06:39-00:07:01 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.335)
He's going to win. He's going to win. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is truly in your hands, Michigan. You have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala Harris, the worst vice president in the history of our country -- he's the worst president, and she's the worst vice president.
Donald Trump
00:07:01-00:07:34 (34 sec)
No Signal (0.576)
They stole the election from this guy. They stole it. They said, "You're out, Joe. You're out." Crazy Nancy, Schumer, all of them, they went in. "You're out of here, Joe." "No, I won 14 million votes." You know, he got 14 million votes. Kamala got no votes, and she took over. That's a threat to democracy, right? You know, to use that term.
Donald Trump
00:07:34-00:08:12 (38 sec)
No Signal (0.725)
But you're going to tell Kamala Harris, and it's going to start right here. You know, if we win Michigan, the whole deal is over. You know that, right? It's all over. You're going to say, "Kamala, you're no good. You did a lousy job. You destroyed San Francisco. You destroyed California. You destroyed everything you touched. You're not going to destroy our nation. Kamala Harris, you are fired. Get the hell out of here. Get out of here. You're fired."
Donald Trump
00:08:12-00:08:34 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.113)
[Applause] All right. We got to get her the hell out. If she did to you what she did to San Francisco, you don't want to have it. She destroys everything. Not a good person either. You know, I see the ads she puts in. Like, I don't have to go into specifics. Anything I did, anything I say, she puts ads in, and we're mainstream.
Donald Trump
00:08:34-00:08:56 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.303)
You know what we are? We're common sense. She will put an ad in, saying the exact opposite of what I believe and what I've been saying for 20 years. She's changed 15 policies in order to be able to run, like no transgender operations for people in detention upon will, paid for by the government. She changed, like, men in women's sports.
Donald Trump
00:08:56-00:09:20 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.168)
She wants men to be able to participate in women's sports. [Audience boos] No. She probably got rid of that. Like, "No fracking. There will be no -- " For her whole life, she's no fracking. "No oil and gas. We don't want oil and gas." So, really, how are we going to get the cars to run? Well, we want to go a little bit further.
Donald Trump
00:09:20-00:09:38 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.385)
How are we going to get them to run? All of these things. She's changed everything over the last year and a half because you can't get elected with that stuff unless you cheat, which is what they do, frankly. But you can't get elected. So, she's changed every one of them. Remember this. Nobody can change like that.
Donald Trump
00:09:38-00:09:57 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.187)
If you change one policy -- one thing with me, I've been consistent. I saw on a fake news show today, I was watching, they said, "Well, one thing you have to say, he's been saying the same thing for 30 years." It's true. They can't steal your car business. They can't take your jobs. You got to stop. It's how I got into politics in the first place.
Donald Trump
00:09:57-00:10:16 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.553)
But we're going to bring all those plants back. We're going to bring all those jobs back. And I've been saying that for -- she's never said that. But every single thing -- and if you have her -- it's not going to happen. I don't believe it. Look, I'm not supposed to say this because you got to vote. If you don't vote -- otherwise, I'm not -- we're doing really well.
Donald Trump
00:10:16-00:10:48 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.026)
We're sort of way up. But I'm supposed to say it's really tight, but you got to vote anyway. You got to vote. In fact, we have a chance of maybe doing something that nobody has ever done before politically in this country, at least not for a long time, but we have a chance. But Michigan, we win Michigan, we win the whole deal, and we make America great again.
Donald Trump
00:10:48-00:11:08 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.947)
You got to get out and vote. [Applause] Early in-person voting in Michigan is now open statewide, and I'm asking for you to go to votetrump.com right after this rally ends, and you're going to see something, but just go. Let me ask you because you have the early vote. You know, it used to be you have one-day voting, paper ballots, voter identification.
Donald Trump
00:11:08-00:11:31 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.134)
Today, it's illegal. You know, the -- how about this guy, Gavin Newscum, in California? He just signed a bill making it illegal to even ask a person for voter identification. They want to put you in jail. [Audience boos] That's the next step. We're going to get this whole thing straightened out. It's crazy.
Donald Trump
00:11:31-00:11:51 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.651)
You know what? Even the Democrats -- it's just the politicians. The Democrats, you go to the Democrats, you take a Democrat, they don't want that. The people, the vote, they don't want that. They want to have voter ID. They want to have proof of your country. In other words, are you a citizen of the country? It'll be nice to have, right? But Gavin Newsom in California, they signed it.
Donald Trump
00:11:51-00:12:11 (20 sec)
Medium (1.608)
I didn't even believe it. I thought it was like an April Fool's. I said, "Are we in April, by any chance?" April Fool's Day. He comes out with a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person whether or not they have voter ID. If you do it, you've broken the law. Can you believe it? So, you'll get arrested if you ask a person.
Donald Trump
00:12:11-00:12:34 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.583)
This is where we're going. It's going to end, and it's going to end very quickly. [Applause] So, as you probably have been reading, we're setting records in the early vote in Michigan and in, I think, most of the other states, and you have until November 3rd to vote early. So, you can do that. But the main thing is to go vote.
Donald Trump
00:12:34-00:13:09 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.477)
You go vote if you want. How many people have voted so far? OK. That's good. How many people are going to vote? So much for our early voting drive, right? By the way, I love that because we're already leading in the early vote, which is something no Republican has done in Michigan since they went to this ridiculous system.
Donald Trump
00:13:09-00:13:34 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.522)
You know what the ridiculous system is? You have the rest of your life to vote, anytime you want. Come on. The whole thing is -- we used to have one-day voting, voter ID, paper ballots. "Prove that you're a citizen of the United States, please." And you know what? You'd had no problems. 9:00, 9:30, you announced a winner.
Donald Trump
00:13:34-00:14:06 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.425)
Somebody's unhappy and somebody's not, but there's no stuff going up to the sky, back, forth. It would cost 8 percent. This is not the most important thing, but it's important. Paper ballots would cost 8 percent of what the machines cost. And paper ballots -- how about these machines? They have the machines, and they said, "We won't be able to give you a vote for six days on election night. We won't be able to give you a vote for six days with paper ballots."
Donald Trump
00:14:06-00:14:26 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.027)
10:00 in the evening, they announce. There's bad stuff going on. Why are we paying 10 times the cost for something that doesn't give you the vote for a long time? You see all the time, they have states that say, "We'll need a few more days with paper ballots." You know, France went to it. They had mail-in voting.
Donald Trump
00:14:26-00:14:46 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.982)
They had all this stuff, and it was really working badly. It was corrupt. And they went to paper ballots, voter ID, same-day voting. They have one day. They had 39 million votes. At the end, they had a winner. They had a loser. And that was it. Everybody went home. It's crazy. And we're going to get it back.
Donald Trump
00:14:46-00:15:05 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.15)
With your help, 10 days from now -- but there's a big lobby against it. You know, a lot of money, a lot of money made with all of the contraptions that they have. A lot of money. A lot of money. Not so much money made with paper. You know, the paper is very -- it's called watermark. It's very sophisticated, actually.
Donald Trump
00:15:05-00:15:36 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.93)
It really prevents you from cheating. With your help, 10 days from now, we are going to win Michigan. We are going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again, and we are going to make Detroit great again finally, after 45 years. [Applause] We're going to make Detroit. I took a lot of heat because, you know, I was up here at the Economic Club.
Donald Trump
00:15:36-00:15:54 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.637)
That's what I was telling you about. These massive factories in Mexico owned by China, but massive factories. And I was here, and I wasn't that positive. I mean, you know, they want me to say, "Oh, Detroit is great. Oh, it's so great." You know, it needs help. So, I said, "It needs help." And people said, "Oh, he wasn't positive."
Donald Trump
00:15:54-00:16:17 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.073)
I can't be positive. I'll be positive. Within two years, I'll be positive. You'll see what positive is. But how the hell can you be positive? No, but that was where I called the gentleman, and I see him sitting there, the man who builds most of the auto plants. He's the biggest in the world, I guess, and I told him I wanted to see a plant a year and a half ago.
Donald Trump
00:16:17-00:16:33 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.575)
He said, "OK, but I'll have to take you to Mexico." I said, "I don't want to go to Mexico. I want to see one here." He said, "We don't build the big ones here." Because you have a stupid head of the union. This guy is stupid. And you know what? We are leading with the rank-and-file of the UAW. You know that.
Donald Trump
00:16:33-00:16:59 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.323)
We're leading by a lot because I'm going to bring your jobs back, and I'm going to end the electric mandate, all-electric mandate on day 1, which is going to cause you all of you to lose your job. You're going to build electric cars, and you're going to build all kinds of cars, except hydrogen. There will be no hydrogen cars.
Donald Trump
00:16:59-00:17:26 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.38)
They tend to blow up. And once they blow up, you are not recognizable anymore. No, they say that's the hottest new thing, hydrogen. Does anybody in the -- they say it's so hot. The problem is when it's not, when it's not hot, it's bad. It's bad. So, I don't want to do that. They say for the most part, for the most part, it's really wonderful, but when it goes bad, it's over.
Donald Trump
00:17:26-00:17:51 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.312)
You're not recognizable. They call the wife. "Please come and inspect to see whether or not this is your husband." He's lying against a tree, and the tree has a lot of red on it. So, we're not going to do hydrogen cars. Is that OK for everybody? Right? [Audience responds affirmatively] They told me -- these guys told me, "We're working on the solution."
Donald Trump
00:17:51-00:18:10 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.241)
Forget it. We got enough. For generations, this state was the world capital of automotive production and one of the great manufacturing centers in all of history. You know, you were the best. You were the best. But then a lot of bad things started happening 40 years ago, actually, but your politicians have done nothing.
Donald Trump
00:18:10-00:18:35 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.754)
They were either stupid or corrupt, one or the other. They were both. But year after year, globalist politicians like Kamala Harris sold you out and let other countries loot and pillage and plunder your wealth and our jobs and our American dreams. Forty percent of Michigan auto jobs were annihilated after NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made.
Donald Trump
00:18:35-00:18:59 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.256)
And I ended it. I ended it with the USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. So much better. [Applause] And then they allowed China in one of their brilliant moves to enter as a growing developing nation. You know, if you're a developing nation, you get all sorts of incentives like things that we have to do that they don't, including pay a lot of money.
Donald Trump
00:18:59-00:19:20 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.095)
So, China entered as a developing nation. Well, I think Detroit and some of our areas makes us a developing nation. China doesn't have any place like that, but they allowed them into the World Trade Organization. That did not work out too well for us, let me tell you, because they robbed us and ripped us.
Donald Trump
00:19:20-00:19:45 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.796)
And I don't blame them if they get away with it, but they didn't get away with it. You know, I charged them more tariffs than China has paid in a thousand years. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars in -- they paid 440 billion or so. You know how much your other previous presidents have gotten from China? Nothing.
Donald Trump
00:19:45-00:20:09 (24 sec)
No StressLens
Zero. Not 10 cents. Not even 10 cents. You know, the press challenged me. "No, no. I think president so and so -- " I don't want to get into it. Oh, Obama did a horrible job. He got ripped. [Audience boos] They said he'd come. He'd make a speech. By the way, I don't happen to think he's a good speaker, OK? I don't happen to think he's a good speaker.
Donald Trump
00:20:09-00:20:27 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.234)
But he'd come, he'd make a speech, and he'd leave. They say other presidents came. They made a speech, and they left. They say, "Trump, he came. He looked at the books. He says, 'You people are being ripped off.'" Then he might've made a quick speech, and he said, "I'll be back in two months." And that's what's happening.
Donald Trump
00:20:27-00:20:52 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.844)
You have been ripped off. This state has been ripped off. The car business is coming back to this state. And in a short period of time, you're going to have more jobs than you had in its heyday, and it's not even going to be hard. [Applause] Under Kamala -- you know, I don't usually use the word Harris because nobody knows who Harris is.
Donald Trump
00:20:52-00:21:11 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.15)
They go, "Harris." People say, "Who the hell is Harris?" You ever notice that, Mr. Congressman? They say -- got all the genius congressmen over here. They're very good. We only let the good ones come. We have plenty of that. We don't like too much. But when I say Harris, Harris has done a terrible job.
Donald Trump
00:21:11-00:21:42 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.016)
Harris is grossly -- nobody knows who the hell -- right? It's true. Isn't it crazy? Harris. Who the hell is Harris? Under Kamala, the U.S. has lost nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs this year alone. You didn't know that because the fake news -- whoa, you got a lot of fake news. You got a lot of bad ones back there, too.
Donald Trump
00:21:42-00:21:59 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.259)
Whoa. That's a lot of fakers. You know, you'd think they'd want their credibility back. You know, when we show clips, they never show them. A friend of mine called up two weeks ago. He said, "You know, I love your rallies, but I'd love to see -- " We do some really pretty good clips that are good, up there, beautiful screen.
Donald Trump
00:21:59-00:22:32 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.991)
So, you take a look up there, take a look up there. No. So, all they have to do is take the camera, go like this, two inches over, one inch up. And the people at home can see it, right? [Applause] And the people then at home can see it, but they don't want to do it. They don't want to do it. Now, you'll watch.
Donald Trump
00:22:32-00:22:49 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.115)
My friends called. They say, "I love your speeches, but when they're playing the tapes, they never show it." All they have to do is turn the camera about an inch, two inches over, one inch up. It goes like this. And they could see it. But they don't want to do that because they don't want to see it. They don't want to have people see it.
Donald Trump
00:22:49-00:23:17 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.017)
U.S. car sales are down 38 percent since I left office. Good job. Good job, Joe, you sleepy guy. I almost said something bad that would've -- oh, I was so close. I was so close. But I think of Franklin Graham. You know, Franklin Graham is a great guy, does a great job with all of these horrible hurricanes and tornadoes and everything.
Donald Trump
00:23:17-00:23:39 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.127)
And he said -- he wrote me a beautiful letter. He said, "President, I love your stories. You speak so well. I love it. It's so great. But sir, it would be even better if you didn't use foul language." And I felt so guilty. You know, I felt like, "Oh, that's a kill." That was in the last paragraph. He's telling me how great -- then he said, "Foul language."
Donald Trump
00:23:39-00:24:02 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.195)
And I gave it a shot. You know, you lose a lot of emphasis, and it's not real bad stuff, but you do -- I said, "Franklin, I think you're wrong." And I do it sometimes that way, and I haven't been able to get quite the same emphasis, but I feel better about myself. I almost blew it right there, almost.
Donald Trump
00:24:02-00:24:23 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.161)
It would've been much better if I did, but then I would've had to report to a higher authority. But with victory in November, we are going to take back what is ours. Standing before you today, I am proclaiming that by the end of my term, the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit. [Applause]
Donald Trump
00:24:23-00:24:52 (29 sec)
Weak (1.05)
We'll bring back the auto industry greater than it has ever been. I'm not saying a little bit. We're going to bring them back. And if they don't want to build their plant here, you know what they're going to do? They're not going to sell cars here. China will not be building those massive plants in Mexico.
Donald Trump
00:24:52-00:25:23 (31 sec)

And a person from a little other state, but he's so important in Congress and such a warrior, I had to introduce him. Darrell Issa. Darrell, thank you. Great job, Darrell. He's a patriot, a warrior, and a House candidate who's going to win.

I looked at the poll. Tom Barrett is going to win, and he's going to win big. Going to win very big, Tom. Great numbers. Michigan GOP chairman, ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, who's my friend.

And we're winning tremendously. I don't think we've ever been in a position like this where we're winning everything. And you know why? Because they're so bad. We're good. We're really good, but they're so bad. And we can't let that happen because our country can't take another -- I'm worried about three months if you want to know the truth.

Dr. Massad Boulos. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Thank you. And Ambassador Joe Cella. Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much, Joe. Here are the facts.

She was an original creator of Defund the Police. You know that? She headed up Defund the Police.

If we didn't have them, we'd never be able to get the bad ones out of our country. They're tough, and they love our country. She vowed repeatedly to ban fracking.
