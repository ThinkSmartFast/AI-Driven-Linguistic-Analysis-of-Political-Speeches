Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Wow, this is a big crowd of beautiful people. Thank you very much. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you. Five days, five days. Oh, we're all working hard. We got to win. We can't let -- we can't let that alternative win. That would be a disaster for our country.
Donald Trump
00:00:36-00:01:10 (34 sec)
No StressLens
So, I want to just say a very big hello, Nevada. We're doing great in Nevada. And I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, and you are that. You are that. But I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question, very easy one. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] I've come today with a message of hope for all Americans.
Donald Trump
00:01:10-00:01:36 (26 sec)

With your vote in this election, I will end inflation. I will stop the massive criminal -- and you see it. You see it, the criminal invasion, horrible, some horrible, deathly people. We're not going to allow it. They're destroying our country. We will stop it immediately. And I will bring back something that you haven't heard of for about four years.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.066)
We're going to bring back the American dream. And I want to just thank you. You're going to bring it back. And that's all you really need to know. And remember, Kamala and Sleepy Joe, they broke it. I will fix it, and we'll fix it fast. And we're going to have America that's bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.048)
And, you know, we're doing fantastically well in the polls, and I want to thank a man who's with us. And I said, "Joe, you got to go," because he's got some big stuff going on, and we got to win this thing. He's heard my speeches before a little bit, but you have a great governor here, Joe Lombardo. And where is Joe? Where is Joe? Thank you, Joe.
Donald Trump
00:02:24-00:02:58 (33 sec)
No StressLens
Is it OK? Can he go and do some business so that we can win, and he can take care of some young people that are incredible and love him? Joe, thank you very much. You go home, Joe. Thank you. Appreciate it. Great job. Joe Lombardo, everybody. Thank you. [Applause] He's a good man. This election is a choice between whether we'll have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:02:58-00:03:21 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.722)
We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring it back fast. And I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country. That's not an easy thing to do when you see these clowns, these horrible, horrible people we have, these horrible people we have running our country. I'm asking you to dream big again.
Donald Trump
00:03:21-00:03:41 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.2)
Dream big again. This will be America's new golden age. That's what we're going to do, a golden age of America. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands. This is a very big state for us. This is a very big state. I love it. I'm here a lot without campaigning.
Donald Trump
00:03:41-00:04:01 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.409)
But I want to tell you, this is a big one, and it looks awfully good. It looks -- I don't want to say -- just keep voting, keep voting. You got to get out and vote. On Tuesday, you have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough. You can't take it anymore. She's horrible, the worst there is.
Donald Trump
00:04:01-00:04:29 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.817)
She's never been -- there's never been anybody worse on the border. She's the worst. She is the worst vice president in the history of our country. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. You're fired. The worst. Horrible, horrible. She is horrible, and she lies. Every time she gets up, she tells a lie.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.029)
Donald Trump will not allow fracking. That's a first, by the way. I won't allow -- "Donald Trump will not allow drilling for oil, which is going to make us rich as hell. No, he doesn't." No, she lies about everything. IVF, she lies. I'm like the -- I feel like I'm the father of IVF. She lies about everything.
Donald Trump
00:04:50-00:05:09 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.242)
She's really -- she's worse than Crooked Hillary, actually. You know, Hillary was a lot smarter, and she lied a lot, but this one lies about everything. She just makes it up as you go. We've been setting records in early voting, as you probably know. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate it. [Applause] But we can't let up.
Donald Trump
00:05:09-00:05:28 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.224)
In-person early voting in your state ends tomorrow, so get out and vote. But the main thing is you got to vote. You got to get that -- Tuesday is a very special day. It's a big day, and we can close this thing out. We're leading for the first time, I think, ever, right? We're leading in early voting for the first time ever. [Applause]
Donald Trump
00:05:28-00:05:48 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.061)
That's right. It never happened because, as you know, Democrats always lead in the early part, and the Republicans like to go there on Tuesday. And they like -- I understand that you want to see your ballot go into a box. I'm not even sure you see that with this craziness that we have. But we're going to get it all changed.
Donald Trump
00:05:48-00:06:19 (31 sec)
No StressLens
But we're doing really well, and to be leading in early voting is unprecedented. So, that's really great. So, it's an honor. And if you can't make it tomorrow, you got to make a plan. You got to be there on Tuesday, everybody. Who has not voted? Whoa, whoa. Who has voted? Great. That is great. Wow. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump
00:06:19-00:07:00 (41 sec)
No StressLens
That's great. Thank you. Look at that. Oh, I bet -- I'd like to know what casino you work for, huh? Look at that. That's great. So, those that haven't, get out and vote. Every vote counts. Thank you very much. With your help, we're going to win Nevada. We're going to defeat Kamala Harris, Kamala. And we're going to -- what are we going to do? We're going to make America great again, right? Over the past four years, Kamala has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people.
Donald Trump
00:07:00-00:07:25 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.446)
She's violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of gangs and criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums, and mental institutions from all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo. Today, I want to hear directly from a mother whose world has been absolutely shattered.
Donald Trump
00:07:25-00:07:39 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.021)
This just came out, and everybody that sees it -- it's, like, devastating, and there's so many things happening like this with the illegal migrants, so many killers. We're not going to let it go on. Please watch.

[Video clip] Sunday night, I asked her to not stay up super late because of her coming to work with me in the morning, first, to do her summer school. She said, "OK." And I told her, "Good night, and I love you." I went to bed not realizing that that was going to be the last time I saw her. We're best friends.
Jocelyn Nungaray

No StressLens
[Video clip] Let's go shake it again. I woke up to notice she wasn't in her bed. I'm, in my heart, trying not to lose my mind because I don't know where she is. I finally remembered her phone had a location on, and her phone was pinging just two minutes down the road, right behind the skate park. I start driving to the direction the phone was being pinged at, and I see a couple cop cars with lights on.
Alexis Nungaray

[Video clip] I see yellow tape, and immediately, my heart drops and sinks to the bottom of my stomach. My daughter's hands and ankles were both bound. She was strangled to death but left with no pants. And I know in my heart she fought incredibly hard. She was not going down without a fight.
Unidentified

[Video clip] We begin with two men, we're learning, are charged with capital murder tonight accused of killing a 12-year-old girl. [Video clip] Police say these men strangled her before dumping her into that creek. Both men were in the country illegally. [Video clip] Apprehended then released by Border Patrol less than three weeks before Jocelyn's death.

[Video clip] Kamala Harris was in charge of immigration and our borders. If we had better border policies and not open borders and not these catch and release policies, I truly believe this all could have been prevented. Under her being vice president of this country, my daughter's life was ripped away from her. She had her entire life ahead of her.

[Video clip] My daughter is six feet in the ground based off of policies that she allowed to keep. Kamala Harris did have one job, and she not only failed -- not me. She failed my daughter. She failed Jocelyn. You know, she was only 12. President Trump reached out, gave me his sincerest condolences as not a former president but just as a father, as someone who cares.

Thank you very much. So sad. Thousands of people all over our country. This is constant. These are some really tough people, some really bad people coming in. They make our criminals look like nice people. That's how tough they are. They are just so bad. The jails are being emptied into our country. Jails from the toughest countries are being opened up and let in through her stupid open-border policies.

No Signal (0.5)
Totally unvetted, nobody knows who they are, where they come from, countries you've never even heard of. The day I take office, the migrant invasion ends, and the restoration of our country begins. [Applause] And I believe it's the biggest problem. Biden and Harris -- you can't say Harris because nobody knows who Harris is.
Donald Trump
00:11:45-00:12:09 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.811)
Nobody knows. You say Harris, nobody knows who the hell she is. But -- [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump."] Oh, that's great. Thank you, darling. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. The savages charged with brutalizing and murdering precious Jocelyn or members of the same vicious Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, and they're taking over apartment complexes in Aurora, Colorado, where you have a governor who's petrified.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.581)
He's a radical-left lunatic, and he's petrified. He doesn't know what the hell to do. He's lost. I call him a lost sheep, and he's unleashing -- they're unleashing a violent killing spree all over America. The United States is now an occupied country. Can you believe? I have to say that, the United -- we're an occupied country.
Donald Trump
00:12:26-00:12:40 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.596)
They're coming in, and they're by the thousands. And they have equipment that's military-grade equipment. How do they get that? They have military-grade equipment. But it will soon be an occupied country no longer. November 5th, 2024, will be Liberation Day in America. Liberation Day. [Applause] On day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history.

00:12:40-00:12:52 (13 sec)
No Signal (0.681)
We're going to get them out. We have no choice. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered. They are conquering areas of our country. They are conquering. We don't know, and nobody wants to talk about it. And the fake news, of which there is a lot back there -- whoa. [Audience boos] That's a lot.
Donald Trump
00:12:52-00:13:20 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.654)
They don't want to write about it. They don't want to talk about it. They don't want to -- they'll write about it after the election. They don't want to write about it now. And we'll put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, or we'll kick them the hell out of our country. We want them out.
Donald Trump
00:13:20-00:13:32 (12 sec)
Weak (1.295)
Through our open border, Kamala Harris is also actively aiding and abetting the worst human traffickers, child smugglers, drug dealers, and bloodthirsty criminal networks on the planet. There's nobody worse than what she's catering to. They even have an app number, where to call, so they can dump off illegal migrants.
Donald Trump
00:13:32-00:13:51 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.124)
They have an app. Can you believe it? They have call -- they have cell phones. They have airplanes flying over the border, loaded up with migrants that they're dropping all over our country. The cartels' profits have soared from relatively minor numbers to $13 billion from human trafficking alone under Border Czar.
Donald Trump
00:13:51-00:14:20 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.253)
She doesn't want to call -- be called Border Czar. She was the Border Czar, but you know what? She was in charge of the border. And by the way, the Border Patrol, they endorsed me very strongly. [Applause] They even said I was the greatest president in the history of our country. Now, I said, "Does that include -- does that include Abraham Lincoln? Does that include the great George Washington?" They said, "You're the best president, and you're the best president on the border. We had the best border."

Drop that, please. Drop my all-time favorite graph. Do you mind? I love this. I sleep with this. I kiss it. I kiss it. Oh, that saved my life, I guess. Without that graph, I wouldn't be here right now. I looked over to my right very quickly, and I noticed there was a little problem, a little bit of a problem.

No Signal (0.486)
Lunatics. We got lunatics out there. But that says it. The last day that I was in office was the arrow on the bottom. That was the lowest day in the history of our country for illegal immigration. That was done by the Border Patrol and ICE. And then it became like an Elon Musk rocket ship. Look at that.
Donald Trump
00:14:57-00:15:18 (21 sec)
Weak (1.047)
Look at what happened. That was the lowest day we've ever had in terms of illegal immigration. By the way, the drugs were equally low. The whole thing was so good. All that guy had to do is leave it. He went to the beach all the time, right? He could have gone to the beach, but he went to the beach, but they made changes instead.
Donald Trump
00:15:18-00:15:42 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.374)
Remain in Mexico. I got things that nobody could come into our country. They had to remain in Mexico. Mexico. I think Tijuana might have been the fastest-growing town in the history of the world, hundreds of thousands of people. But they weren't in our country. And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally, right? We want people to come in, but they have to come in legally.
Donald Trump
00:15:42-00:16:10 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.271)
We don't want murderers and drug dealers, and we don't want them to open their prisons. Think of it. They're opening their prisons and dumping them on us. But every day, they're stealing innocent lives on both sides of the border, both sides. Just days ago, a young U.S. Marine Corps veteran named Nicholas Quets from Arizona was driving through Mexico very routinely, who would think this could happen, for a beach weekend with his great friends.
Donald Trump
00:16:10-00:16:28 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.812)
Everybody loved him. He had a lot of friends. When he was viciously gunned down on the highway and murdered by members of a Mexican cartel. And we're joined today by Nick's wife, Karime; his father, Douglas; his mother, Patricia; his sister, Alexis; and his brother-in-law, Phil. And they're beautiful people.
Donald Trump
00:16:28-00:16:43 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.702)
And if they'd like to come up, I'd love to have them, just to honor their beautiful boy. I'd love to have them. Come on up. Oh, good. That's great. [Applause] This is a great family, a perfect family. And what happened to them should happen to nobody.

So, unscripted, I really wasn't planning on being here. Two weeks ago, I was a completely apolitical actor. Anybody outside my own home wouldn't have known who I would have voted for. Today, the situation changed for me last two weeks ago, Friday. My son was murdered by cowards, shot in the back on the way to the beach in Mexico.
Doug Quets
00:16:57-00:17:18 (21 sec)
No StressLens
The reason I bring that up -- and some people will question, why was he in Mexico? He was in Mexico, going to pursue his life, enjoy his life. We grew up as a military family, had been around the water. He loved it. We don't have Arizona beach, so we call Rocky Point Arizona's beach. A lot of people go there.
Doug Quets

Hundreds of thousands a year, I think, transit there. Plenty of Americans own property down there. So, that happened. We got the call from the State Department, very professional, that night. No news in the United States to speak of. Sunday, still no news. Monday, still no news, other than the very most local level with no publication, tried to get in contact with elected leaders, heard nothing.
Doug Quets
00:17:42-00:18:22 (40 sec)

Tuesday, reached out to my local representative. He put me in contact with Senator Vance. Senator Vance coincidentally was coming to Tucson for a speech that day. I can't imagine how busy Senator Vance and President Trump are running their campaign. Senator Vance asked for two minutes to talk to him.
Doug Quets
00:18:22-00:18:40 (18 sec)
No StressLens
And, you know, I've met in my line of work -- and I'm actually still a current federal employee. That's one of the reasons I've stayed apolitical. I'm a 20-year military retiree. So, I've dedicated my entire life to this country and doing -- [Applause] My son, who was murdered, is a four-year military veteran of the United States Marine Corps.
Doug Quets
00:18:40-00:18:56 (16 sec)
No StressLens
He did -- he worked on vertical assault from the Ospreys, so he'd fast rope out of helicopters. My daughter is actually a drilling army reservist, and my son-in-law recently medically retired due to issues sustained on active duty. So, our family is a military family with generations and generations of service. [Applause]
Doug Quets
00:18:56-00:19:41 (45 sec)
No StressLens
I bring these things up as an apolitical actor and somebody who struggled, the kind of Americans many are, who probably sit around their table and say, "Who are we going to vote for?" Go back and forth, decide what we think is important. And we struggle on that, and we actually pray on it. And many people ask me, how can I stand up here today, 13 days after my son was killed, and talk in front of groups? And it is through the grace of God, and I do believe in God and a higher being. [Applause]
Doug Quets
00:19:41-00:20:32 (51 sec)
No StressLens
I do believe -- I do believe my son, Nicholas, has given me the power to be here, has given my wife the power to be here, has given my daughter -- Karime, who is Nick's wife; and my son-in-law, Philip. And Philip has done such a great job. So, now I have one living son, and that is Phil, because one was stolen by the cartel.
Doug Quets
00:20:32-00:21:00 (28 sec)
No StressLens
So, when I met with Senator Vance -- and because I am apolitical, I have met many political -- many leaders up to the level of National Security Council, plenty of times working different issues for this government. I asked him a question, and I said, "Sir, before we talk, I need to know if I'm speaking to the candidate, the senator, or the Marine."
Doug Quets
00:21:00-00:21:19 (19 sec)
No StressLens
And he said, "I'm JD. I need you to tell me what I can do for you, and you tell me what you can do for me." And he meant it as a way of helping him to help me. So, JD Vance was awesome. I asked for 90 seconds. He gave me 15 minutes. [Applause] The very next morning -- [Audience member calls out "We can't hear you."]
Doug Quets
00:21:19-00:21:51 (32 sec)
No StressLens
Better? [Audience responds affirmatively] The very next morning and after having tried to reach my elected officials for five days, President Trump's office called me. President Trump, in the fight of his life, offered to meet with us. President Trump gave me 15 minutes of his time to talk about what we could do.
Doug Quets
00:21:51-00:22:28 (37 sec)
No StressLens
I asked him for some things, and he helped. I asked him, A, for U.S. involvement, and we know he's candidate Trump right now, and there is a seated president. I asked for U.S. involvement in the investigation with the Mexicans. I asked for extradition of the killers after I found out, under the current U.
Doug Quets
00:22:28-00:23:02 (34 sec)
No StressLens
S. code, not all can be extradited, only if they're tied to RICO activities. In this case, they probably are tied to RICO activities. They are probably coming back, but I'll defer all questions on his investigation to the FBI. And I asked for a working policy in Mexico. In my career, I worked in -- one of the things I worked on was Plan Colombia, very similar situation in security as to what we have in Mexico today.
Doug Quets
00:23:02-00:23:21 (19 sec)
No StressLens
It was supported by Senator Biden. That's out in public record. You can look at it. We have no working policy with Mexico right now. Count the numbers of illegal immigrants, whether they're private, whether they're dangerous or not dangerous, and you'll see a number of about 25 million crossing back and forth.
Doug Quets
00:23:21-00:23:42 (21 sec)
No StressLens
And then when somebody says, "Why was Nick in Mexico," my son was an hour from our house when he was executed by cowards. That's how close it is. But it is a national security challenge, not a local border state challenge. We have this type of things with Tren de Aragua and Ms-13, anybody else you want to name, plus unnamed criminal organizations.
Doug Quets
00:23:42-00:24:03 (20 sec)
No StressLens
The cartels, they operate with impunity in Mexico. They've infiltrated every level of their government. The local police are helpless because they're not properly equipped. State police, a little bit better, and then the federal. But we need to work with the Mexicans on this to go forward. So, what I'm leaving you with, and I'll give this back to President Trump, to whom you came to listen, not me, is this.
Doug Quets
00:24:03-00:24:20 (18 sec)
No StressLens
For most of us in this room, and honestly, I would not have been in this room because I wouldn't have been political two weeks ago, you know who you're going to vote for. But for the soundbite and the people looking at this, after 12 days, I received a phone call from Senator Mark Kelly. That was the 12th day.
Doug Quets
00:24:20-00:24:44 (23 sec)
No StressLens
And he was gracious, and he offered his condolences. And I told him, "Sir, I appreciate that," because I'm a respectful person, and I'll work with anybody. But what I want is sponsorship of a couple of things. One is change to U.S. code so that if people are -- committed crime against U.S. persons, especially murder, they are brought back here to face our justice. [Applause]
Doug Quets
00:24:44-00:24:59 (16 sec)
No StressLens
Number two is legislation that is enacted that takes us someplace closer to Plan Mexico that will institute not only military capability but also institution building. And if we break out the numbers of what it costs, we can do that for much less than we spend on illegal immigrants, and we can make both sides of the border secure.
Doug Quets
00:24:59-00:25:17 (18 sec)
No StressLens
People are coming here. Some come from economic, and we talk about that. But many of those people are actually fleeing due to the insecurity in their own country. If we can help them, we can help ourselves. Senator Kelly, and as I said -- so this is bipartisan, but we need a leader who can enact it, and the leader is standing right next to me because he's promised to enact it.
Doug Quets
00:25:17-00:25:47 (30 sec)
No StressLens

In fact, I want to get insurance companies to pay for the IVF if possible. We want to do it.

So, she's the one who threatens your health care, and according to recent studies, Kamala's plan for giving free health care to illegals will destroy Medicare. It will destroy our country. It will cost $2 trillion. She wants to do that. She will -- that's something she'll do. I will -- and by the way, if you tell them, then they're going to come.

And it's a tragedy. If you say you're not going to get it, then they're going to stay where they are, and it's not a tragedy. I will never let our country be destroyed. The reason Kamala's campaign has been reduced to this desperate, pathetic stream of hoaxes and lies is simple. The entire world can see she's a train wreck who is totally unqualified to be the president of the United States.

She's totally unqualified. [Applause] There are some people who thrive under pressure, and there are some people who crack under pressure. And the more pressure Kamala is under, the more pressure she unravels. You know, people didn't know her. She's only had a few months because she had that little honeymoon period.

And remember, she was introduced, and she got on stage, and she went, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." It's like 50 times thank you. I say, "What the hell is wrong with her?" But the press never picked that up. If I did that, I would be -- it would be over.

Remember that, when she was -- right? Was that a little weird? She said it like 42 times. "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." But being a candidate is nothing compared to the pressure of being president. I know both.

Do you want to lose your life savings because we put a weak and foolish person in the White House? That will -- that's going to happen. If that happens, it's going to happen.

Do you ever hear her talk about the economic situation? Oh, my, it's crazy. She shouldn't be here. The presidency is a job held by Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan, and people of strength and high intelligence. Would you trust Kamala to talk to Russia or China about nuclear war? [Audience responds "No"] But I can.

We had no wars. And China paid us hundreds of billions of dollars. And Kamala -- think of this, hundreds of billions of dollars, China. And Russia, I ended their pipeline. They had Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever heard of it until I said, "Wait a minute. They're building a pipeline in Europe that's going to Germany with offshoots all over the place. They're going to build a pipeline."

I terminated that pipeline, and then they said, "He's been nice on Russia." Think about that, Matt. I've been nice on Russia. I terminated the biggest job they've ever even conceived of, and then they say, "Oh -- " But I do get along with Putin. And, you know, that's a good thing. And I get along with President Xi, and I get along with Kim Jong Un.

But they respect us. They respect us a lot. Now, they laugh at us. They think we're a joke. Would you trust her to steer us out of an economic crisis? [Audience responds "No"] Nothing is more dangerous than to give immense power to a person with a very low IQ. You wouldn't put Kamala in charge of, literally, a kindergarten class.
Donald Trump
01:18:58-01:19:19 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.186)
You wouldn't. So, at the end of the day, you need to ask yourself, can you afford to put someone that's grossly incompetent in charge of the future of our country? I don't think so. On top of all that, Kamala says she would do nothing differently. She was asked that question. Please look.
