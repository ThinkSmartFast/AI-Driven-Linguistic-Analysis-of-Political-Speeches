Medium (1.929)
Thank you. Thank you. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Wow, what a crowd this one is, huh? What a crowd. [Applause] Even up in the rafters. I don't know. You guys OK? Can you see that? Hello up there. I have some friends up there. They couldn't get seats. Can you believe this? Thank you very much, everybody.
Donald Trump
00:00:38-00:01:05 (27 sec)
Weak (1.035)
It's great to be in Milwaukee. We love Milwaukee. [Applause] And a very special welcome to -- we love this place, right? We got it, the ship contract. We got it, the biggest shipping contract. You know that. We love being in Wisconsin. I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots.

No Signal (0.386)
That's what you are. And we have a country that's going to hell, but we're going to turn it around very fast. And I'd like to begin with a very simple question, very simple. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] So, I've come today with a message of hope for all Americans with your beautiful vote.
Donald Trump
00:01:32-00:02:02 (30 sec)
Medium (1.749)
We don't want your money. I don't want your money. I want your damn vote, OK? [Applause] We want that vote. I will end inflation. I will stop the criminal invasion of our country, the biggest problem we have right now, and I will bring back the American dream. And this is all you really need to know.
Donald Trump
00:02:02-00:02:28 (25 sec)
Weak (1.336)
We have somebody who's grossly incompetent as -- I guess -- I don't know. Is she the vice president, the president? Is she a contender? What the hell is she? Kamala broke it, and I will fix it, and we'll fix it very quickly. And America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before.
Donald Trump
00:02:28-00:02:51 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.18)
It's going to be. You watch. This is going to be so much fun. That's the good thing about that little slippage that they had, that little -- you know, because it showed how bad they are. It showed how bad they are. And there's never been spirit like we had. There's never been any race that we've ever had in the history of this country that's had this kind of spirit.
Donald Trump
00:02:51-00:03:32 (41 sec)
No StressLens
So, I just want to thank everybody. [Applause] This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. They're going to be the four greatest years. And I'm asking you to -- it's very hard for you to do this, to be honest with you, because you look at what's happened to our country, and how the hell can you do this? But I'm asking you anyway to be excited about the future of our country again, just be excited.
Donald Trump
00:03:32-00:04:08 (36 sec)
Medium (1.605)
We're going to turn it around. And I'm asking you, dream big, the American dream. Just dream big. We're bringing it back. This will be America's new golden age. It's going to be the golden age. Look at this place. I mean, what the hell? How do you beat it? How do you beat it, huh? [Applause] How's Eric doing? I think very well. [Audience responds affirmatively]
Donald Trump
00:04:08-00:04:29 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.784)
Oh, boy. He's a great guy. He's a great-looking guy, too. Sometimes, I'd say maybe he'd be better off without that mustache. I'm not sure. He looks so -- he's such a handsome guy. I said, "I don't know." But, you know, I guess you'd better leave it because I hear you're leaving, so we have to leave the mustache, right? And you're doing great, Eric.
Donald Trump
00:04:29-00:04:56 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.827)
Boy, oh, boy, we love it. We love it. We love this whole place. We had a little event here, you know, recently. You know that, right? That was the convention. We had the convention, and I had a little -- I had a little patch on my ear, excuse me, a little patch. I said, "I don't know." I was a little embarrassed walking out with the patch, but there's nothing you can do about some things, right? Every problem facing us can be solved.
Donald Trump
00:04:56-00:05:28 (32 sec)
Weak (1.15)
But now, the fate of our nation is in your hands. It really is. We win this state, we win the whole thing. You know that. [Applause] On Tuesday, you have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough, that you can't take it anymore. She's been the worst vice president in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:05:28-00:05:59 (31 sec)
Weak (1.248)
And you remember, just five months ago, everybody was saying, "She can't run. She's grossly incompetent." She was the worst vice president in history. We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala. You're fired. Get the hell out of here. [Applause] So, today was the last day for in-person early voting for most of Wisconsin.
Donald Trump
00:05:59-00:06:27 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.017)
There's a little tiny section, but I'm not going to get into the detail. But you still have until Sunday to vote early here in Milwaukee as well as in Madison and Green Bay and Racine. Racine. We love Racine. We just left Green Bay. We had a great event. Was anybody at the one in Green Bay? That was a good one.
Donald Trump
00:06:27-00:06:54 (27 sec)
Weak (1.061)
That was -- how's your football team? You know what I liked? I love Brett Favre. And we got a call from Brett, and you have to -- I mean, he's a great guy, and boy, what a player. I shook his hand. I said, "Man, that hand is -- that's the biggest hand I've ever seen." His fingers were like sausages. That's why he could throw a ball 80 yards, right? No, he was great, but he wanted -- he never did it before.
Donald Trump
00:06:54-00:07:17 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.609)
It's such an honor because he never did it before. [Audience chants "Turn it up."] Thank you very much. No, Brett never did that before. You know, as an athlete, it's hard to do a little bit. You can't do it. You lose some fans maybe. Who knows? Crazy people that say, "Oh, I don't like him because he likes somebody."
Donald Trump
00:07:17-00:07:40 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.211)
But Brett was great, and we had an unbelievable day. And to get his endorsement -- and he wanted to do it right here. He wanted to do it right in Wisconsin. Any place, he said, in Wisconsin, and he gave me a full endorsement. and that was a great honor, right? That was a great honor. Great guy. [Applause] He could really rip that ball.
Donald Trump
00:07:40-00:07:58 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.273)
So, thank you very much to Brett. So, get everyone you know. You have to do it. You have to vote, vote, vote. We're going to win this thing, and we're going to win it big, and I'd love to win it right here. I'd love it. And if you haven't voted early, just come on Tuesday. We don't care at this point.
Donald Trump
00:07:58-00:08:15 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.748)
We don't care when you vote. Just make sure you vote. And if you see anybody cheating, you know what you do? You know what you do? Report them immediately. No, we're doing -- we're doing great. We're leading just about -- I think all seven swing states, we're leading, but don't listen to me now. Don't listen.
Donald Trump
00:08:15-00:08:31 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.451)
Just pretend we're one down, right? We're one point down, please. We don't want to say, "Oh, we don't have to vote today, Alice, because he's leading." No, don't do that. We've seen that stuff happen. We don't want to do that. [Audience chants "Fix the mic."] Oh, the mic. Yeah, I think the mic stinks.
Donald Trump
00:08:31-00:09:11 (40 sec)
No StressLens
I think it stinks. All right. Crazy, crazy. Oh, that's what -- I was wondering what the hell they were shouting. I think this mic stinks, by the way. And then we don't pay the contractor. I say, "Don't pay the contractor," then they write a story. "Trump doesn't pay his bills. He's a bad guy." No, the mic is terrible.
Donald Trump
00:09:11-00:09:39 (28 sec)
Weak (1.207)
It was -- I had another one today. You know what? I've done three of these today. Somebody said -- somebody said, "Maybe what we could do is maybe we could just skip the last one." I said, "There's no way I'm skipping. There's no way." And this is the best one of all. Look at this place. [Applause] Thank you.
Donald Trump
00:09:39-00:09:58 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.658)
The ladies from North Carolina, 259 of these, they've come to. Look at them. They're beautiful. I don't know where the hell their husbands are. They're married. All of them are married, but they're great. And thank you very much. We're coming -- we're rounding the turn, aren't we, huh? We're rounding the turn.
Donald Trump
00:09:58-00:10:32 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.495)
And we have Front Row Joes over here. Look at them. And we have Mr. Wall over here. You know, it is sort of sad. Is that mic now better back there? [Audience responds "No"] Oh, that pisses me off. They don't -- they don't get it. Well, the mic at Madison Square Garden worked very well. Was that a great event? [Audience responds affirmatively] But honestly, it was basically the same, the same crowd as you have here, right? Same thing, your NBA arena, your team is very good.
Donald Trump
00:10:32-00:10:56 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.33)
I would say the Greek is a seriously good player. Do you agree? [Audience responds affirmatively] And tell me, who has more Greek in him, the Greek or me? I think we have about the same, right? He is some -- he's a great player, maybe the best player in the NBA, actually. He may be the best player. He's supposed to be a very good guy, too.
Donald Trump
00:10:56-00:11:34 (38 sec)
No Signal (0.154)
But with your help, we're going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we're going to make America great again. [Applause] Thank you very much. Thank you. So, in breaking news, the economy created a pitiful -- you won't even believe this. The economy stinks. What timing, what timing. Four days before the election, they have among the worst numbers ever in history nobody's ever heard.
Donald Trump
00:11:34-00:12:05 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.637)
They did 12,000 jobs. Normally, you're 250,000, 300,000, 400,000, They did 12,000. Think of it, 12,000 jobs. [Audience boos] And it's hundreds of thousands of jobs less than it should be because they're pathetic. They don't know anything. These people don't know anything. She's a very low-IQ person. We don't need a low-IQ individual.
Donald Trump
00:12:05-00:12:33 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.371)
We just had that for four years. We don't need this. But those numbers are so low. They're almost disqualifying. The only thing good about the numbers I'm going to give you now are that it's great to run against the people that created those numbers because it's terrible. And just think a few months ago, they fraudulently claimed -- remember? Three months ago, 818,000 jobs.
Donald Trump
00:12:33-00:12:59 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.163)
It was a fraud. Everything they do is a fraud, and then they go after people that aren't frauds. They're a fraud. The whole operation stinks. But they created 818,000 fake jobs, and they thought they'd get away with it. And a whistleblower blew the whistle, and they blew the whistle. They thought they were going to announce -- they call it a correction.
Donald Trump
00:12:59-00:13:24 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.123)
That's a hell of a correction, by the way. That will be the world's biggest correction in history. What do you think, Ron Johnson? That's the biggest correction, was it? You know, corrections are meant for like 700 jobs, not almost a million jobs. But now, they've just revised the past jobs number, right, your last month, and they revised it downward by 112,000 fake jobs.
Donald Trump
00:13:24-00:13:45 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.228)
So, these guys are playing fast and loose. These are crooked people we're dealing with. The people we're running against are crooked as hell. So, that's almost a million fake jobs. And I think it's something that Congress ought to look into, really. They ought to look into -- who the hell ever heard of these numbers? And they wanted to revise them after the election.
Donald Trump
00:13:45-00:14:12 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.212)
Could you imagine if you lost the election? And then two days later, we've revised the numbers downward, 1 million jobs. Nobody's ever heard of it. But we thank you, Mr. Whistleblower. You know, some whistleblowers are very good. Kamala's failed economic agenda wiped out nearly 30,000 private sector jobs and nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs in just the last month.
Donald Trump
00:14:12-00:14:41 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.832)
Do you believe this? Nobody's ever heard of these numbers. Even I -- I mean, I know they're incompetent, but I thought they were sort of riding along a little bit on what we built. With almost 100,000 manufacturing jobs killed since the beginning of the year, 100,000. That's a lot. A hundred and fifty thousand -- these are all the numbers coming out of the so-called government, great government we have.
Donald Trump
00:14:41-00:15:00 (19 sec)
Weak (1.271)
One hundred and fifty thousand Americans joined the unemployment rolls last month. This is like a depression. And there's nothing -- I mean, no event. I think they're trying to blame it on the hurricane. No, that was, you know, a little -- a relatively small area. No, not the hurricane, not the hurricane.
Donald Trump
00:15:00-00:15:26 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.797)
They're the hurricane. And nearly a quarter of a million people dropped out of the labor force, which is almost unheard of. No, no, these are the worst numbers anybody's ever heard of. The data shows that 100 percent, listen to this part, of all new jobs, net job gains in the past year have gone to illegal migrants. [Audience boos]
Donald Trump
00:15:26-00:15:51 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.643)
And the jobs were taken from African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and union workers. I don't think the unions are too happy about this. But I told you this was going to happen. It was inevitable. They're letting millions and millions of people flood into the country, and the African American population -- if you see these numbers now -- they're going to release them.
Donald Trump
00:15:51-00:16:14 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.386)
But I think maybe, Ron, you should try and get them early because they're really bad. They have taken so many jobs away from African Americans, less from Hispanic, but that's going to catch up. But the African American job picture is unbelievable. And we had it going so good, but they've come in illegally, and they've taken the jobs.
Donald Trump
00:16:14-00:16:39 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.671)
And people that have had jobs for 20 years and good jobs, and they raised the family, they had a little house and everything nice, and they've now lost their job to illegal migrants that have poured in through the open-border policy of that stupid person. Kamala's inflation nightmare has, think of this, has cost the typical American family $30,000.
Donald Trump
00:16:39-00:17:02 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.508)
Think of that one. Higher prices because the inflation is just raised. And, you know, it started when they played around with my energy. I had no inflation. We had the greatest energy we've ever had. I was going to have it four times higher by now. And we're going to do that, but we got a little bit of a delay because -- and we were going to have it four times higher.
Donald Trump
00:17:02-00:17:21 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.371)
We were going to take care of Asia. We're going to take care of Europe. We're going to take care -- we're going to make a fortune, start paying down debt. We have 35 trillion in debt. We're going to lower your taxes. I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and the largest regulation cuts, and we were able to do more. [Applause]
Donald Trump
00:17:21-00:17:48 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.593)
Thank you. Thank you. And now, she wants to impose the largest tax hike in American history on top of everything else and raise your taxes by more than $3,000 a year. Is everybody happy? [Audience boos] I don't want to ruin your night, but don't worry. We're going to make it good. We're going to -- you got to suffer a little bit to get them out.
Donald Trump
00:17:48-00:18:16 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.343)
Get those people out. They're grossly incompetent. I stand before you today as the only candidate who can rescue our economy from total obliteration and restore it to strength, prosperity, and actual greatness. We're going to restore you to greatness. [Applause] As the just-released numbers plainly indicate, the economy is now a disaster.
Donald Trump
00:18:16-00:18:41 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.706)
And are you listening to this press? They're the most dishonest human beings on Earth. Are you listening to this? [Audience boos] These people, you know, whenever I look at them, they turn the cameras off. The red lights go off like -- you see them all go. They don't want any part of it. Now, that's a lot of press.
Donald Trump
00:18:41-00:19:01 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.41)
That's a lot of cameras going so late at night. But no, we're going to -- we're going to bring it back, and we're going to bring it back fast. You know what we're going to do. We're going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to get the energy down. It's going to come down. We're going to drill, baby, drill.
Donald Trump
00:19:01-00:19:22 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.626)
But I don't know if you know it, the -- their economy is expected to get significantly worse. How does it get worse than that? It's really bad. Top Wall Street analysts like Scott Bessent, who is one of the most brilliant guys on Wall Street, he said that the only reason the stock market is up is because everyone thinks Trump is going to win the presidency. [Applause]
Donald Trump
00:19:22-00:19:45 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.349)
That's pretty good. That's pretty -- we had a great stock market. Can you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929-style depression. I believe that, too. No, that would crush your incomes and kill millions of jobs and wipe out your savings. We're not going to let that happen. You got to get out and vote.
Donald Trump
00:19:45-00:20:16 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.91)
Just got to get out. I don't like to say, you know, when I win. No. I get -- I sort of say -- should I say when or if? [Audience responds "When"] You know -- I know, but it sounds a little braggadocio, right? All right. When I win, you are four days away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks, and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen. [Audience chants "USA"]
Donald Trump
00:20:16-00:21:06 (50 sec)
No StressLens
Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you. Thank you. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and for our seniors, ready? No tax on Social Security benefits. And I am going to -- this was given to me by a friend of mine. Actually, this was given to me by a great political reporter, a she, said, "Sir, why don't you support and give a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one?" I said, "That's a good idea."
Donald Trump
00:21:06-00:21:26 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.113)
So, we're going to do that. You know, if you didn't have those people, you would not have enough hospitals in this country to take care of anything. You'd need to double your hospitals, and you still -- those are the greatest people on Earth, and they do it with love, and we're going to get them a tax credit.
Donald Trump
00:21:26-00:21:45 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.095)
Is that OK? It's about time. To rapidly reduce inflation, I will end Kamala's war on American energy. We're going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to frac, frac, frac. You know, she goes, and she says, "Oh, no, I've always wanted to frac." This woman, she's the worst liar. Look, I had to go and beat Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Donald Trump
00:21:45-00:22:05 (20 sec)
Weak (1.038)
She's crooked as a $4 bill. You know, I've never held a microphone up so long in my damn life. It's like I'm weightlifting. Sucker's heavy. But she's crooked as hell, right? Crooked Hillary. But she was less -- like, she didn't lie this way. This woman, "Trump is going to do -- he's going to terminate your Social Security in his first week in office."
Donald Trump
00:22:05-00:22:29 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.784)
No, no, no. I'm the one that's going to keep it going. No increases in age. "He's going to ruin Medicare. He's going to do that." I see her today. She's at a news conference. First of all, she's exhausted. She looks like -- no, she's exhausted, right? Man. And you know what? I've gone 62 days, no days off.
Donald Trump
00:22:29-00:22:52 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.386)
I've done so many. I've done so many. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. No, I've gone 62 days. Today is an example. Yesterday, I started off in New Mexico. You know why? It's not really a swing state, but it's a state that likes me a lot. It's got a thing called a border, and it's an open sieve, and people are pouring in by the thousands and thousands and doing a lot of destruction and doing a lot of crime.
Donald Trump
00:22:52-00:23:30 (38 sec)
Weak (1.356)
And I went there. We had a massive crowd. You couldn't even see the end of it. It was like early in the day on a regular weekday. And today, I was in Michigan. We were all over the place. We were in Michigan, but I said -- and Michigan is very important. You know, we're leading in Michigan. You know why? I'm going to bring back -- I'm going to bring back the car business, a little thing like that.
Donald Trump
00:23:30-00:24:02 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.933)
You know, I told them today, a year ago, I heard through a friend of mine who builds plants. He's a great plant builder, the best and the biggest in the world. He's building this massive plant, and I wanted to see it. I said, "I want to see the plant you're building." He goes, "Well, it's not in the U.S."
Donald Trump
00:24:02-00:24:48 (46 sec)
No StressLens
I said, "Then I don't want to see it. I'm not interested. I have no interest. Where is it?" "It's in Mexico." "Who owns it?" "China." They're building this massive -- they didn't start it. They're building this massive plant right on the border, so they can make cars, sell them into the United States, and destroy the rest of Detroit, take all the business away from Michigan and, in all fairness, Tennessee and South Carolina and lots of other places and you, to a lesser extent, but you, too.
Donald Trump
00:24:48-00:25:11 (23 sec)
Weak (1.121)
But they're going to build this big plant, and I didn't like it. I said, "That's killer." You know, they're trying to solve the Detroit situation, and we want to bring back company -- and we're going to bring them back because -- you know why? The most beautiful word in the entire dictionary, you know what it is? It's tariff.
Donald Trump
00:25:11-00:25:36 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.615)
The tariff. You're going to become so rich with the word tariff. You're going to become rich as hell. You're not going to know what to do with the money. I'm telling you, you're going to become very rich. The word tariff. And so, I told them, and I was at the Detroit Economic Club. It was beautiful, and I was giving a talk.
Donald Trump
00:25:36-00:25:52 (16 sec)
Medium (1.888)
And I saw the guy that told me that they're going to start building a big plant in Mexico, right on the border. And he was in the audience. John, his name is. He's, I think, the biggest in the world at this stuff. He's very good. And he told me, if you asked me to build an apartment, I couldn't build it or a road.
Donald Trump
00:25:52-00:26:13 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.958)
They couldn't lay the asphalt. But a plant, he has no problem with, with computers all over the place and robots. Lots of robots, by the way. So, I said, "Well, how's that going?" I was making a speech, and I saw him right about there, where that very beautiful girl is. I'm not allowed to say that. See the beautiful blond girl right there? I said -- no, you know, that's the end of your political career when you do that.

We're suffering, climate change. If it's cold, that's good. If it's hot as hell, that's good. It used to be global warming, and that wasn't working because we're actually cooling. So, we have that.

Thank you, Brian. What a good job you're doing. I heard him speak the other day. I was in the plane, flying in, and he was up, speaking. You are good. You are psyched, right, like we all are. We want to win. This is the biggest win. This will be the biggest win. Think of it. And if we win the whole thing, it'll be the greatest event in political history in this country and maybe beyond.

Remember Pocahontas? Her mother said she had high cheekbones, which I think is very racist for somebody to say. I think it's a racist statement. I think you should investigate that statement. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being president of the United States.

Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorse a total ban on handgun ownership. Who in this room is willing to give up their gun, please, to Kamala? [Audience boos] Who refuses to give up their gun? [Audience responds affirmatively] I think she has a very tough job. But she even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. [Audience boos]

And perhaps worst of all, she lied about working at McDonald's. She lied. She never worked at McDonald's. Never worked there. She never worked there. She's a liar.

And remember, when you're about to press that lever, and I told you this before, everybody wanted that damn boat contract to build like 28 destroyer-type boats.
