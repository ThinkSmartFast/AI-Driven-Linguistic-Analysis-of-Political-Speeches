# **AI-Driven Linguistic Analysis of Political Speeches: A Comparative Study of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump During the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election**

**GenAI for Humanities. Capstone Project**

## **1.	Introduction**
   
**Project’s Objective:**

To analyse the linguistic characteristics and rhetoric strategies in the political speeches of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, identifying linguistic patterns that reflect their political agendas and persuasive techniques, by utilizing Generative AI methods and tools. By analysing contemporary political speeches, the project ensures timely and meaningful inquiry.

**Research Question:** 

What linguistic style and features distinguish Kamala Harris’s and Donald Trump’s political speeches during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, and how do these choices reflect their political agendas and strategies for persuading voters?

**Hypothesis:**  

The political speeches of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump exhibit distinct linguistic styles: Harris’s speeches feature structured, analytical language aligning with a formal and considered tone, while Trump’s speeches are characterized by more conversational style designed to foster emotional resonance with voters.

**Prediction and Expected Outcomes:** 

*“Language is power”* (Carter, 1983). While Kamala Harris’s choice of vocabulary is carefully considered and reflects focus on analytical clarity, Donald Trump’s style prioritizes accessibility and emotional impact. These distinctions manifest in patterns such as word choice, sentence types, and the frequency of rhetorical devices, as revealed through Generative AI analysis.

## **2.	Methods:**
   
**Data Collection:** 

To explain differences in the linguistic styles of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, I analysed 60 speeches (30 from each candidate), delivered during the 2024 election campaign.

To answer the research question, written transcripts of Kamala Harris’s and Donald Trump’s speeches were sourced from Roll Call, which has covered Capital Hill since 1955 (https://rollcall.com). The search terms “Donald Trump” and “Kamala Harris” were used to retrieve relevant speeches.

**AI Techniques:** 

To achieve the study’s objective, linguistic features that best characterize the differences between the two speakers and relate to the messages they aim to convey were investigated. Generative AI (GenAI) was employed for text analysis, focusing on topics, word count, nouns, adjectives and pronoun usage, and average sentence types. 

**Validation:** 

Manual reviews were incorporated to cross-validate AI-generated insights, mitigating potential biases. 

**AI Techniques Employed:**

A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the 60 political speeches was conducted using large-scale language models and Python programming. Generative AI tools helped to uncover patterns, enhance the research efficiency, enable large-scale analysis, foster new interpretations, broaden the scope of research, and visualize data. Python code was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT.

In addition to leveraging generative AI for large-scale text analysis, this project explored the interpretive potential of AI-generated insights by contextualizing findings within existing literature on political linguistics. This approach ensured a balanced synthesis of computational and humanistic perspectives.

## **3.	Results and Discussion**
   
**Topics of Political Speeches**

•	AI-enabled analysis of political speeches revealed that Donald Trump prioritized topics such as the Economy, Immigration (including Border Security and Illegal Immigrants), and Crime. Other key areas included Patriotism, Inflation, and the Military.

•	For example, Kamala Harris asked her audience:

*“What kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear, and hate? Or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law?”
“Are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it?”*

•	In contrast, Donald Trumps questioned:
*“But I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”*

## **4.	Conclusion**
   
AI-driven analysis of a political corpus comprising 60 electoral speeches reveals a notable difference in the linguistic styles of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Harris employs structured and analytical language, reflecting a formal and thoughtful tone, whereas Donald Trump adopts a more conversational style aimed at creating emotional connections with voters. 

Both candidates convey their vision through personification, utilizing pronoun such as “I” and “We”, and “You” to foster connection and resonance with their audiences. However, the share of these pronouns is higher in Kamala Harris’s speeches compared to those of her opponent.

In contrast, Donald Trump’s speeches are, on average, three times longer. He also focuses on fewer key words, which helps his messages stick. He is confident in not only keeping attention, but also energizing his enthusiastic supporters, who helped to carry him to the While House.
