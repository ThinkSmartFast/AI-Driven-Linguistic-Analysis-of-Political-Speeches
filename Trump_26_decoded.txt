[Audience chants "Trump"] [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. And I'll tell you, I love this state. I love Georgia. I love Georgia. And I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible place with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are.

You are hardworking. You're great. We -- we know how good you are. And we're bringing this country back fast. We're going to bring it back fast. I'd like to begin by asking you a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] With your vote on Tuesday, I will end inflation, I will stop the invasion of criminals coming into our country, and I will bring back the American dream.

We're going to bring back the American dream. We're just two days away from what will be the most important political event in the history of our country. I believe that. But you have to do one little thing. I don't want your money. I don't want anything. The only thing I want is get out and vote. Just get out.

Finish it. You know, we're on the five-yard line, maybe even the one-yard line. We're -- we're right there. We had a tremendous number of early votes, a record-setting number, records like nobody can believe. I -- but all I can say is, on Tuesday, just go out and vote, and we're going to close this thing out, and it's going to be party time.

We're a nation in decline like we've never seen a decline. What they've done to our beautiful country is just, just so horrible.

Nobody's going to believe it. We're going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to bring it back so fast. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. This will be the golden age of America.

What a beautiful -- isn't that a beautiful term? Think of that, the golden age. This will be the golden age of America. Think of that, how beautiful that sounds, and it's true.

I said, "Harris was out tonight." "Who's Harris, sir?" Nobody knows who she is. But on Tuesday, you have to stand up and tell Harris that you've had enough, you can't take it anymore.

I always ask this, would anybody like to give up their ticket to somebody outside, no? [Audience responds "No"] Would anybody like to hand over their gun to Kamala? [Audience responds "No"] Is there anybody, one person in this giant tens of thousands of people, one person would like to hand out their gun, you'd be famous for the rest of your life?

She wants to confiscate your guns, you know that. With your vote, we are going to win Georgia, we are going to defeat Kamala, and we are going to make America great again.

They come from mental institutions, and they come from insane asylums.

Just days ago, right here in your state, an incredible 25-year-old mom, beautiful mom, named Mimi Rodriguez-Ramirez, was kidnapped from a Walmart parking lot, a parking lot that was safe. She was horribly abused and murdered, violently murdered. A week later, her body was dumped on a road, was found by the police in condition that they said they've never seen anything like that before.

The animal who murdered Mimi was an illegal alien who came to Georgia to maim and kill people. It made no difference who they were. Mimi leaves behind a 9-year-old daughter and her absolutely wonderful mother, Carmen.

Hello, everyone. The president is a lifelong friend of mine, and he is one of the best men I have ever known. I speak about him often, and I like to tell people about his humanity, his sensitivity, his empathy. I am a member of a very bad club. It's the club of parents who have buried their children.

When my son Andrew died, there was one person who supported me unconditionally. That was President Trump and his wife Melania. We were having a conversation, and I told the president that my son Andrew leads me to others who have been in distress. Several days ago, that happened again. As a member of this audience, Josh McKoon, who you heard earlier, was a great guy, told me about a Georgia woman, Mimi, who had been murdered.

I told the President the circumstances, and he was shaken. He asked me what we could do about it and told me to reach out to the family and do whatever we could. I flew to their home tonight to pick them up and bring them here, and they are here tonight distraught and sad, but I believe uplifted, and they are Trumpers and have voted for him in this election, all of them, because they remain hopeful, as they told me earlier, that even after this terrible tragedy, this president, when he becomes president on Tuesday, can bring us out from the abyss.

Let me tell you briefly about Mimi's family. They are hardworking, from Puerto Rico, living in Georgia, making a home for themselves.

And they're incredible patriots. They them and ICE and law enforcement and our sheriffs. Our sheriffs are great police all over the country.

And we're going to free them up to stop the crime in our cities and stop the crime in our country. And they know, I have to say, you know, somebody said, "Well, how would you do this?"

Now, I can't stand that, Marco. So, no this was the other night. She made a speech. Every sentence was about me. Our great first lady said, "Darling, are you OK?" I could -- they ask her about the economy. Donald Trump. No. They've been there for four years, the whole thing. What they did to this country is record-setting, and especially at the border, especially at the border, because that inflation is going to come roaring down.

You know, as soon as we open up the gas -- the oil and gas, you know, we had $1.84 -- you know, I used to say $1.87, I was actually -- I was corrected by the government -- by the government manuals, so I said, "I'll take it, 3 cents." But we had $1.84 gasoline. Do you like that, how does that sound? Today you're at $3.

75, but if anything happened with the election, you'd be at $7.89 a gallon. Kamala's campaign is running for nothing but hate and demonization, calling half of America garbage. You saw Joe -- do you think they were happy with Joe the other night? "When -- these people are garbage, they're garbage," oh, I said, "Oh, is he screwed now with them," he says -- That's lasted for about -- that's lasted.
Donald Trump

Sarah, that's lasted for about five days now, this is not good. And, perhaps, that's why we're leading by so much, but that's not really the reason. The reason is, that first little question I put, we built a great, great economy. And their economy is terrible because of inflation, in all fairness, largely because of inflation, but inflation's a real bad word.

Meanwhile, Kamala says she would not do one thing differently from Joe Biden, which in itself is disqualifying. "I wouldn't do one thing, how about the 325,000 children that are dead, missing, or slaves." She wouldn't do that to them. Our country is almost at a 90 percent wrong track, the highest in the history of our country, and she says, "Oh, I would do nothing different." Take a look.

[Audience boos] Can you believe it? Nothing. You know, a smart person would say, "Yeah, let's see, I'd strengthen up the border. I'd do something on inflation. I'd do that." It would be 20 different things, she couldn't think of anything. This is not what you want to be a president. So, if you want to end this disaster, you have to go out, get out and vote.

And just in conclusion, we want to just introduce a few people that are incredible. They're really incredible. Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones. Thank you for being here, Burt. Great guy. The great senator from Florida, and he's a tough guy. I had to compete against this guy. This guy was not easy. He's tough.

He's tough, and he's smart, and he's my friend, Marco Rubio. Thank you, Marco. And former Senators David Perdue, he's working so hard, and Kelly Loeffler. Thank you, Kelly. Thank you, David. Somebody I'm very proud of, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Representatives, warriors, by the way, Andrew Clyde, Austin Scott, Mike Collins, Marjorie Taylor Greene.

And a guy who was great in the Mueller hearings. Remember, he was hitting up Mueller with so many questions. Mueller said, "I don't know. I can't. Where the hell am I?" After two years, he had no idea what was happening. And we were totally exonerated, by the way. Totally, 100 percent exonerated. But this man was great.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.445)
You got to see his voice, chiming through those beautiful, hallowed halls, screaming at Mueller. It was an unfair -- it was unfair competition. Former Congressman Doug Collins. Thank you, Doug. And candidates for Congress, Brian Jack. So, Brian Jack. I hated when they took Brian Jack. They came to me and they said, "We'd love to have Brian run in his home district, where he was born and raised."

I said, "Look, between you and I, just tell him it's not available." I didn't want to lose him, but he figured it out. And I endorsed him so heartily. And he's a great gentleman. Right, Chairman? He's a great -- he's a great gentleman. Brian Jack. It's an interesting name because, you know, with people -- there aren't too many.
Donald Trump
00:59:18-00:59:40 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.946)
But when people have that kind of a name, Brian Jack, a lot of people call him Jack Brian. I asked him that question, and I said, "It doesn't really matter, you know. You get the idea." But Brian Jack is a great guy, and he's going to be a great congressman or whatever he wants to do for a long time to come.

Thank you, Brian. And he worked for me, and he was always there. And also, Wayne Johnson is going to be great. Wayne Johnson. And he said -- look at that look he's got. Although looks don't mean anything, please remember that. Looks -- you're not allowed to talk about looks anymore in this politically incorrect.

He looks -- especially if he were a woman, that would be bad. And, you know, nowadays, with this administration, you can become a woman if you'd like. I don't think you should -- I have a feeling that he's going to take a pass. Do you believe what's happening with that -- with that whole situation? But I hear you're doing great, and you're going to be very successful.

And you do indeed have the look. Whether I'm supposed to say it or not, who cares? Thank you very much. Agriculture commissioner, and he's a good one, Tyler Harper. Thank you, Tyler. He's a good one. And your incredible GOP chair, Josh McKoon, who is great. I don't want to talk about him too much, though, because, you know, if some crazy thing happens on Tuesday, I can't say -- because then I'd say, he didn't do a good job, but now he's done a great job.

And I hear we're really in great shape, right? We have record-setting early voting, numbers that nobody's ever seen before. Can you believe that? I mean, basically -- correct me if I'm wrong, but the Republican Party never wins early. We'll be 200,000, 300,000, 400,000 votes behind, and they consider that good.
Donald Trump
01:01:54-01:02:31 (36 sec)
Weak (1.476)
But it's just the opposite. We're hundreds of thousands of votes ahead. Nope, this has never happened before. But it all means nothing if you don't go out on Tuesday and vote. Right, Josh? We have to get them to vote. And, of course, I just introduced him, the legendary Herschel Walker. We love Herschel.
Donald Trump
01:02:31-01:02:49 (19 sec)
Weak (1.11)
Thank you, Herschel. You look good, Herschel. I also want to send our prayers to everyone here in Georgia who is still recovering from Hurricane Helene. And I want to also thank you, Governor. He's been very gracious. He's working very hard on making sure that we win this vote on Tuesday. So, I want to thank very much, Brian.

That's very good. That's really nice. Thank you very much. Everybody's working as a unit because winning this vote -- and, by the way, winning this state -- we win this state, and it's over. It's over. So, get out there and do it. Kamala's hurricane response was a disgrace and actually a betrayal. It was just reported that almost 50 percent of phone calls to FEMA for disaster aid went totally unanswered.

You know why? Because they spent their money on illegal aliens, people coming into our country illegally. Many of them very bad people. [Audience boos] So, you cannot trust this person. Anybody doing that, you can't trust that person to be president. You had the worst hurricane, like, maybe ever, and, boy, did North Carolina get hit, but you got hit really hard.

And you had -- and, you know, I want to thank Elon Musk, OK? Because Elon, the head of North Carolina Rescue, and your governor, and also some of your people that did a really great job but had very little federal help, they asked, "Would it be possible for you to call Elon Musk?" And he gave me the greatest endorsement ever.

I mean, how good is it to get his -- because we like intelligent people. We've got to protect our brilliant people. We don't have too many of them. And when I saw that rocket come down, the way it came down was so beautiful, boom, right on the pad. It was unbelievable. I said, "Was that yours?" "Yes."

Oh. Can Russia do it? "No." "Nobody can do it. China?" "No. Nothing. Nobody can do it." And I said -- he does something called Starlink. And the man from -- a very good official, by the way, state official. He's from North Carolina. He said, "Sir, could you call up Elon Musk? I know you have a good relationship. We want Starlink."
Donald Trump
01:05:15-01:05:50 (34 sec)

I said, "What the hell is Starlink? Tell me about it." "It's a communication system. All of the wires in parts of Georgia, too. All of the wires are down. And it's very successful. It's very hard to get. We can't get them, and we need it." And people are dying. They have no communication. And people are dying.

And I called Elon. I said, "Elon, you got to do me a favor. Do yourself a favor. Do humanity. They got to get this thing you have called Starlink. And you got to get it fast, Elon."

I said, "How the hell did you do that, Elon?" He said, "Well, I can do two things at one time, can't I?" And the following day, it got delivered to North Carolina, Georgia, and other places that needed it. And it's very hard to get. And I actually asked him -- in all fairness, I got to give Elon a little boost.
Donald Trump

I actually asked him, "Well, how does that compare to the wires that have to go all the way down and ground and on poles and everything else?" He said, "Actually, it's much better." So I said, "You know, got to rethink that whole situation." But Elon has been great in that way. You know where he is right now? He's campaigning for me in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Can you believe it? That rocket went up. And I mean, the thing was down for probably 30 minutes, and he announced he's going to -- because he thinks this election is the most important thing maybe to ever.

And he's a very smart guy. But how good is that? Think of it. He is campaigning for all of us. He's not campaigning for me. Thank you very much, sir. That's fine. All right. That's very good. I like that. I like that. I like that. How can I get angry at this guy? Right. Normally, I'd say, "Who the hell is in front of me with a sign?" But that sign is OK, sir.

So, just in closing it out, here are some of the facts. Kamala is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas or so. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of defund the police. Think of that. And anyone who wants to defund our great police for even a day or a week is not worthy of being president of the United States, because that's their thinking.
Donald Trump
01:08:33-01:09:09 (36 sec)

That's their ideology. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. Can you believe? "Let's go ICE. Get out of here. We'll take care of these tough killers." She wouldn't do it. Tell you who wouldn't have the guts to do it. Liz Cheney wouldn't have the guts to do it. Liz Cheney. [Audience boos] She's a big talker. "We're going to put thousands of soldiers and and they'll die. They'll all die. I'll be sitting home with my dad who ruined --"

think of all the people that are dead right now. And then they wonder why Kamala is doing so badly with the Arab Muslim population in Michigan. You see that? They're doing bad. Who the hell -- if you're a Muslim Arab, you're from that part of the world, who the hell is going to vote for her? Her father unleashed a spree of death on all of their countries.

And then, she doesn't understand. See, I would say that Kamala's pick of Liz Cheney, Marjorie, is not the best. And they're wondering why they have virtually no votes from that particular community. I thought I thought about it took me about a second. They said, "Well, that's not a very good person to be campaigning with, I don't think."

They went from 100 percent approval to about 4 percent now. And you know who's got the approval? Me, because I want to see peace all over the place. We had no wars. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She ruined San Francisco, probably the greatest city in our country 20 years ago.

She destroyed it. And she's not going to be allowed to destroy our country. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayers expense. [Audience boos] And, perhaps, worst of all, she never worked at McDonald's. She never did. She lied about that. So, with your vote on Tuesday, we're going to fire Kamala, and we are going to save America.

We will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to the state of Georgia. We will build America, and we will buy America, and we will hire America, and the jobs are going to be boring. And I will end the war in Ukraine, which would have never happened if I were president.

And I will stop the chaos in the Middle East. October 7th would have never happened if I were president. And I will prevent World War III from happening.

I rebuilt our entire military, but they gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan. Can you imagine that? They gave billions and billions of dollars away, but it's still only a fraction of what we have.

And I hate -- I hated doing it because it's obliteration. We don't want that to happen. And, you know, Russia and myself in China, we're talking about de-escalation, actually, of nuclear.

You don't know who to talk to. Here's -- on a much larger scale, to put it mildly. On the largest scale in the world, you call the United States because we have a problem with something.

And we will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. [Audience responds affirmatively] And we will keep men out of women's sports. That's like a no-brainer.

And I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our Second Amendment. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we are found -- we are going to just do this.

Can you imagine using -- can you imagine, five years ago, somebody, me, standing up and saying, "We will not be invaded, we will not be conquered," because we are being invaded. Can you imagine that we even think of that, that we're using those expressions? Can you imagine that I'd be up here saying, "And I will stop men from playing in women's sports?" What the hell?

I read so much, and it's such a big deal. So, as I said, I've been doing this for nine years. I've never had one person -- you know, they come up, "Sir, I think you should cut taxes.

We should have one-day voting with paper ballots, voter ID, and proof of citizenship. Yes, I'm a United States citizen. And you know what? The voting would be concluded at 9 o'clock.

because, you know, we did a great job for four years. Right to try, another thing we did, right to try.
