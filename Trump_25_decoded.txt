No Signal (0.306)
Thank you very much. Thank you and a very, very special hello to Pennsylvania. What a great -- what a great place. And I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are. [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump. We love you."]
Donald Trump
00:00:22-00:00:45 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.233)
And I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now or -- just remember this. I'll tell you what, you remember it. Do you like it better now or four years ago? Well, I asked it a different -- you like it better now or four years ago? And I've come today with a message of hope for all Americans.
Donald Trump
00:00:45-00:01:06 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.137)
With your vote on Tuesday, I will end inflation, I will stop the invasion of massive numbers of criminals coming into our country -- thank you very much, Kamala and Joe -- and I will bring back the American dream, and we'll bring it back stronger than ever before. [Audience member calls out "Thank you"] But this is all you need to know.
Donald Trump
00:01:06-00:01:39 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.247)
Kamala broke it, and we will fix it, and we're going to fix it fast. America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. The election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence and failure, which is what we have right now, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:01:39-00:01:58 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.555)
And I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. I'm asking you to dream big again. This will be America's new golden age. This is going to be a golden age. And it's hard to believe, isn't it, huh? We're talking about a golden age, but that's hard to believe because we have been so low.
Donald Trump
00:01:58-00:02:22 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.829)
We've never been this low. The image of our country is terrible. It's terrible. It's a failed country. That's what it is. They view us -- they view us as a nation in decline. But even worse, they view us as a failed country. We're going to turn it around. The image is so bad. What they've done to our country -- these incompetent group of fools, what they've done to our country is so damn bad.
Donald Trump
00:02:22-00:02:44 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.803)
And the media -- and the media is so damn bad, it's unbelievable, every [Audience boos] -- every inch of it. Every problem facing us can be solved, but the fate of our nation is in your hands. On Tuesday, you have to stand up and you have to go. You got to just go out and you got to stand up. We've done this for so long.
Donald Trump
00:02:44-00:03:19 (34 sec)
No Signal (0.368)
This is nine years. We have to get out. [Audience member calls out "Too big to rig"] But you have to tell that horrible, terrible, the worst-ever vice president -- nobody knows where the other guy is. Where the hell is he? Where the hell did he go, David? Where is he? Nobody knows where the hell -- where is Biden? Remember, we used to go where is Hunter? We used to go where is Hunter? Now, we go where the hell is Biden? Where's Joe? [Audience member calls out "Cheating"] You know, when you think, they just stole -- they stole the election.
Donald Trump
00:03:19-00:03:37 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.041)
It was just they walked in, they said, "You're out." [Audience member calls out "Never again"] Right? That's a threat to democracy. They call me a threat to democracy. They stole the election from this guy. Whether you like him or not, they stole the election. They walked in, they said, "Get out of here, Joe. You're out. You're dead. You're out, Joe."
Donald Trump
00:03:37-00:04:08 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.628)
And man, oh, man, he likes me better than he likes her, I really believe. And you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough, Kamala. You've had enough. You're the worst ever. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. Get out. You know, it's -- it's amazing. I watched her yesterday, and she's saying all these things she's going to do when she gets to office.
Donald Trump
00:04:08-00:04:30 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.001)
First of all, she's got three more months. But more importantly, why the hell didn't she do this stuff before? [Audience member calls out "Right"] First of all, none of it did she believe in, none of it. She has changed 15 different policies. She's a radical left Marxist. And if she ever heads this country, this country is finished, and I say it loud and clear. [Audience member calls out "More trouble"]
Donald Trump
00:04:30-00:04:52 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.304)
Everything we've been fighting for so hard to achieve for the past nine years all comes down to the next two days. Think of it. We've worked in this for nine years. And we got a phony press. We got a lot of crooked people out there. We're fighting like a son of a gun. We're fighting. They want it -- they want to -- they are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing.
Donald Trump
00:04:52-00:05:16 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.404)
Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on in your state. [Audience member calls out "Too big to rig"] Every day [Audience member calls out "Thank you"] they're talking about extending hours and stuff. What? Who ever heard of this stuff? We should have one-day voting and paper ballots. Then I just heard that a couple of states may go an extra 12 days.
Donald Trump
00:05:16-00:05:37 (21 sec)
Weak (1.018)
How the hell do you have an election? [Audience boos] You know, they spend all of this money on these damn machines. And paper ballots, you'd have the -- you'd have the answer by 9 o'clock tonight. It's damn -- it's a damn shame, and I'm the only one that talks about it because everyone is afraid to damn talk about it. [Audience member calls out "That's right"]
Donald Trump
00:05:37-00:06:08 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.493)
And then they accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist. "He's a conspiracy --" And they want to lock you up. They want to put you in jail. The ones that should be locked up are the ones that cheat on these horrible elections that we go through in our country. And I don't know what's going to happen, but for future elections, I -- I won't be even a part of it, but you ought to damn well go to paper ballots, you ought to go to voter ID [Audience responds affirmatively] and you ought to have the election over by 9 o'clock.
Donald Trump
00:06:08-00:06:42 (34 sec)
No StressLens
I'm hearing now they're going to take weeks. [Audience member calls out "Cheaters"] [Audience member calls out "You'll win."] Can you imagine, they spend all this money -- all this money on machines and they're going to say, "We may take an extra 12 days to determine?" And -- and what do you think happens during that 12 days? What do you think happens? [Audience member calls out "Cheating"] [Audience member calls out "Too big to rig"] These elections have to be -- they have to be decided by 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock on Tuesday night.
Donald Trump
00:06:42-00:07:06 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.374)
A bunch of crooked people. These are crooked people. You know, in California, they just signed a bill that if you're an official or anybody, you're not even allowed to ask anybody for their voter ID. [Audience boos] And if you do, you've created a criminal act or something. I mean, they only do that because they want to cheat.
Donald Trump
00:07:06-00:07:29 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.104)
What the hell are they doing? The whole world is laughing at us. They're laughing at us. You know what? And if nothing comes out of this whole thing, it's going to teach you, you damn well get -- better get a different system. And these bloodsuckers up there, they do nothing about it. [Audience boos] What a shame? What a shame? That's why they laugh -- the world laughs at us.
Donald Trump
00:07:29-00:07:49 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.097)
They all have elections. You know, France -- France had crooked elections because they had paper ballots years ago and they switched. And now, they have paper ballots. And at 9 o'clock in the evening, they called the winner, they called the loser. Everyone went home. Everybody was fine. They had voter ID.
Donald Trump
00:07:49-00:08:08 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.482)
They had paper ballots. They had one-day election. At 9 o'clock, it was over. They called the winner. They called the loser. Everyone went home. Now, they say we'll wait till the next time. We got to get smart as a country. This is just one thing. It's all corrupt. She's corrupt. She's a corrupt person. [Audience member calls out "Yes"]
Donald Trump
00:08:08-00:08:30 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.144)
I'm running against a totally corrupt person. And I'm really not running against her. I'm running against a corrupt machine called the Democrat Party. It's totally a corrupt party, guys like Adam Shifty Schiff. These are corrupt people. And to think he'll probably be a senator. Can you believe it? [Audience responds "No"] Watermelon head.
Donald Trump
00:08:30-00:08:55 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.454)
No, he's a watermelon head. He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen. I don't know how the hell he can hold up that enlarged watermelon head. What a -- what an ugly guy, both inside and out. But it's now or never. This is it. This is the moment. We've been waiting nine years for this and we got two days and we got all this crap going on with the press and with the fake stuff and fake polls.
Donald Trump
00:08:55-00:09:16 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.536)
And by the way, the polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there. They can make those polls sing. They can make them sing. They brag about it. I got a poll. I'm 10 points up in Iowa. One of my enemies just puts out a poll. I'm three down. Joni Ernst called me. Everyone has called me. They said, "You're killing in Iowa."
Donald Trump
00:09:16-00:09:34 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.682)
The farmers love me and I love them. But they came up -- [Audience member calls out "We love you so much."] they just announced a fake poll -- hey, think of it -- right before the election that I'm three points down. I'm not down in Iowa. I got $28 billion for the farmers [Audience member calls out "Yes"] 28 billion.
Donald Trump
00:09:34-00:09:59 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.053)
Nobody else would have gotten $0.10. Joe would sleep. He would -- do you think he thinks about the farmers? And you know who gave me the 28 billion for the farmers? China because China screwed our farmers. And then they tell me I'm down in Iowa. I don't think so. And you know what, a good poll, Emerson, no friend of mine, they said that poll is wrong.
Donald Trump
00:09:59-00:10:20 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.328)
Everybody said, "Why do they announce a poll that's highly skewed toward Democrats and liberals? Why do they do that?" When you read it [Audience member calls out "Cheaters"] they interviewed far more Democrats than they did Republicans. Why do they do that? Why do they do that? And I guess there's a law that they have to say that because they would have preferred not having to say that.
Donald Trump
00:10:20-00:10:40 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.48)
Our country is a crooked country, OK? It's a crooked country, and we're going to make it straight. We're going to make it straight, and it's not an easy thing to do. They'll want to put you in jail because you want to make it straight. Think of it. Think of it. They cheat on elections and you call them on it and they want to put you in jail.
Donald Trump
00:10:40-00:10:56 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.84)
Think about it. It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen, but I love it. You know why? Because we've proven something, we've shown something, and we're going to get it fixed, and we got to win this election. It's all up to now. I mean, we got two days. We've been working for nine years. We did a great job.
Donald Trump
00:10:56-00:11:12 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.146)
We had the best economy ever. We had the wall. We had everything. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] I built [Audience member calls out "We love you."] over 500 miles of wall. They don't even talk about the wall. But we had the best border, the safest border. I won't pull down my world's favorite chart because I don't want to waste a lot of your time.
Donald Trump
00:11:12-00:11:34 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.817)
But my world's favorite chart, done by the Border Patrol, it said we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left, I mean, honestly, because we did so -- we did so well. We had such a great -- so now -- I mean, every -- every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.
Donald Trump
00:11:34-00:11:51 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.94)
It's all about the lawyers. Everybody is standing, lawyers. Nobody should have that. You should have a damn ballot and you hand it in. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] Do you know that in Arizona, where I'm winning by a lot, but it takes four hours to fill out the ballot? They've got page after page, and people are complaining.
Donald Trump
00:11:51-00:12:17 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.162)
They don't have time. It takes four hours to fill it out. Why is that? Why is that? I can tell you why. But so many places. Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania. I went to school here. I think the people are incredible. But they found, as I understand it -- I mean, I don't know what's happened in the last day or so.
Donald Trump
00:12:17-00:12:40 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.073)
But they -- in Lancaster, they found 2,600 ballots all done by the same hand. [Audience member calls out "That's trash"] In other words [Audience boos] the same exact penmanship, the same hand, the same everything. It was all done by the same pen, the exact same pen. And then they go and they say, "Well, this is -- he's a conspiracy theorist."
Donald Trump
00:12:40-00:12:58 (18 sec)
Weak (1.281)
[Audience member calls out "President Trump"] It's a terrible thing that's happened to our country, and the whole world watches it, even third-world countries. I was telling a friend who came in last night. He comes from a country. He works there a lot and comes from -- knows it. And it's not a great country, to be honest with you.
Donald Trump
00:12:58-00:13:17 (19 sec)
Weak (1.034)
And he said, "But when we vote, they take our fingerprints and they check our fingerprints. We can't get away with anything." This is a third-world country. In our country -- think of it -- you are not allowed to even ask for somebody's voter ID. And if you do ask, I think they have the right to put you in jail.
Donald Trump
00:13:17-00:13:44 (26 sec)
Weak (1.115)
Not the one that's cheating, the one that's asking. "I want -- I want honesty." "Oh, let's go to jail." It's a terrible thing. And I tell you what, I love being off these stupid teleprompters because the truth comes out. [Applause] [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump."] The truth comes out.
Donald Trump
00:13:44-00:14:01 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.749)
And at least you find out that it's nice to have a president that doesn't have to use teleprompters. You ever see her? And I'm being nasty to her because, you know what, she's really bad. She shouldn't have been chosen. She got no votes. It's -- this is supposed to be a democracy. You could call it a republic.
Donald Trump
00:14:01-00:14:22 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.079)
People say, "Oh, it's a republic." OK. Whatever you want to call it. It's supposed to be fair. And they ripped the election away from this poor stupid guy. They ripped it away like -- like candy from a baby. It's the way you do -- you ever take candy from a baby? "Hello, darling. Give me some of that candy. Just give it to me."
Donald Trump
00:14:22-00:14:41 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.151)
You take it. You rip it right out of the baby's hand. That's what happened here. It's a corrupt deal. And I think, at some point, it's got to be changed, got to be changed. Do you know that paper ballots -- and by the way, now, the machines are going to really hit me hard because, you know, they never heard anybody hit them like this.
Donald Trump
00:14:41-00:15:13 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.357)
But do you know that paper ballots -- paper is very sophisticated. It's called watermark. It's watermarked, highly sophisticated. This is -- it's more sophisticated than the machines they use, which can be hacked and things can happen. You know, a great gentleman is Elon Musk. [Audience member calls out "Yeah"] Right? And I said to Elon, "I assume you're very good with computers, right?" He said, "Well, I think I'm one of the best."
Donald Trump
00:15:13-00:15:30 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.816)
He said, "It wasn't the engines that landed that rocket the other day. It was the computers telling the engines what to do. I think I'm good. Yeah, I think I'm really good." Well, he looked at the machines, just looked at them, and he doesn't have to look like normal people. Normal people have to rip them apart and figure out what's going on.
Donald Trump
00:15:30-00:15:56 (25 sec)
No StressLens
That's normal. Experts, he goes like this, the machines are -- "Oh." He looks -- "Oh," meaning he knew immediately. You know, he does this stuff for a living. So, he looks. And he actually made the statement. He said, "Look, computers are great for sending rockets up and everything else, but there should never be machines used in voting."
Donald Trump
00:15:56-00:16:22 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.405)
Everything should be paper ballots put in boxes, voter ID. Also, identification -- identification for the country. In other words, little questions like are you a citizen of the United States? These are -- these are little questions. These aren't big questions. "Excuse me, ma'am. Are you a citizen of the United States?" "No, I'm not."
Donald Trump
00:16:22-00:16:40 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.41)
You're not allowed to ask. "Oh, what city do you live in?" "It's none of your business. I'm voting. Do you understand?" [Audience member calls out "That's crazy"] Now, if you show up in a suit and tie and they say, "We don't want this guy voting --" You got to see what they do. I mean, what they do is so sad.
Donald Trump
00:16:40-00:17:02 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.785)
But Elon is a total pro. And I saw his mother, the most elegant woman. I said, "Elon, she produced you." Well, she produced one hell of a smart guy, but I'm saying -- did you see his mother with a beautiful white hair? She looked like total royalty. And she said she went, I think, to New York, and she pulls out identification.
Donald Trump
00:17:02-00:17:22 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.602)
No, I don't need that, ma'am. "Oh, of course you, do. It's my --" She wanted to give it. They didn't want it. And she said, "Very interest --" She was interviewed just yesterday, a very smart woman, produced a lot of smart kids, too. Not just Elon, a lot of smart kids. And she was amazed. She left there.
Donald Trump
00:17:22-00:17:43 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.577)
They didn't want any information. They didn't want her ID. They didn't want identification. And she said, "You know, that's a strange thing. I've been in many countries and they always want your identification." So, look, we have a country with a massive headache, and it would go a lot longer than headache.
Donald Trump
00:17:43-00:18:17 (34 sec)
Weak (1.371)
It would be a much stronger word than the word headache. And we have to solve this problem because we have a mess on our hands. We got a bunch of cheaters that all they do is think about how they can cheat. Think of this. You know, when I run this election, we have meetings with Susie and Chris and all professionals, respected people, a lot of people, and we talk about strategy like what do you think we're going to say or where do you -- where are we going to hold a rally and how much are things going to cost and what are we doing? You know, in other words, normal.
Donald Trump
00:18:17-00:18:59 (42 sec)
No Signal (0.957)
When they meet, they meet to find out how can they cheat. And when you think of it, they have to because who wants to have policies of open borders where anybody in the world can come in, where you can -- and -- and by the way, 90 percent of the Democrats, not the sleazebags like Schiff and Schumer and -- or Nancy, crazy Nancy Pelosi [Audience boos] [Audience member calls out "And she's trash"] Pocahontas, not -- not those people, but the people that vote, you know, the -- the real Democrats, they actually tell me all the time, "I don't know why the hell we can't have voter ID."
Donald Trump
00:18:59-00:19:22 (23 sec)
Weak (1.046)
The real Democrats want to have things like voter ID. They know it's crooked. There's only one reason you don't want voter ID. There's only one reason, and that's to cheat. There is no other reason. There's no other reason. [Audience member calls out "That's right"] And they do cheat. [Audience member calls out "Do we have any chance to win, Mr. President?"]
Donald Trump
00:19:22-00:19:43 (22 sec)
Weak (1.251)
Isn't this better than my speech? [Audience responds affirmatively] Isn't this? No, because, honestly, somebody's got to talk about it. They say, "Sir, I'd rather have you not talk about it. I -- we have a certain network. Oh, if you even mention the fact that there's cheating in an election, they turn you off."
Donald Trump
00:19:43-00:20:10 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.421)
I mean, this is supposed to be one of our brave -- very brave networks. I won't mention which, but you can imagine. You know, it's one thing when CNN and MSNBC -- crooked as hell. Look at CBS. Look what CBS did. They took this person who's a low-IQ person, they took her, they interviewed her. And the main question they asked her, she gave an answer that was absolutely insane.
Donald Trump
00:20:10-00:20:35 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.56)
It was a pile of words taken, mixed up, and thrown onto a board. It was the -- it was the craziest freaking answer I've ever seen. And CBS, who's licensed for free -- they don't pay anything -- by the federal government. Why -- why aren't these licenses bid out? Why aren't -- they're worth billions of dollars.
Donald Trump
00:20:35-00:20:58 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.264)
All they're supposed to do is be honest. So, CBS, now, their main news show is "60 Minutes." "60 Minutes" took her answer, realized it was a disaster. And you know they wouldn't do it for me. No. They would love me to give that guy [Audience member calls out "You would never mess up anyway."] And -- you're right.
Donald Trump
00:20:58-00:21:22 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.506)
So [Audience member calls out "I love you."] she said, "You would never mess up anyway." You're right. I mean, you know, somebody asked, hey, I sat -- I sat for a three-hour [Audience member calls out "I love you."] interview with Joe Rogan, and it was great, and you have to be smart. I -- I sat -- two days ago, I sat with Tucker Carlson and we had an interview, an hour and a half.
Donald Trump
00:21:22-00:21:43 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.104)
It was at 11:30 in the evening after I did four rallies, and it was fine. You know, I mean, they ask you a question -- you know, it's very simple. They ask you a question and you give them an answer if you're intelligent. But she's not an intelligent person. She was not a good student. She was a horrible student.
Donald Trump
00:21:43-00:21:59 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.277)
She didn't -- she didn't pass her bar exam. [Audience member calls out "No, she didn't."] I mean, I know a lot of people, they didn't pass it, but, you know, that's OK. But she didn't pass it, but she was a horrible student. She's not a smart person. We're dealing against the roughest, toughest, smartest.
Donald Trump
00:21:59-00:22:19 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.148)
Oh, the press goes crazy. If I say vice President Xi of China is a brilliant man, they go crazy. "He called him brilliant." Well, he runs a 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. Yeah, I'd say he's brilliant. That doesn't mean he's a good person. I happen to think -- I mean, what happened -- what he did with COVID was -- I called that along.
Donald Trump
00:22:19-00:22:37 (18 sec)
Weak (1.087)
I said it came from the Wuhan lab, and people have a lot of different theories on it. I happen to think it was gross incompetence. [Audience member calls out "China virus"] The -- the doctor came out of the lab. He had lunch with his girlfriend. She caught it. He caught it. They caught it. They -- everybody started dying all over the place.
Donald Trump
00:22:37-00:23:03 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.596)

And I want to just tell you that what they've done -- so you add the 112,000. So, you're talking about almost a million jobs were faked. Now, here's the difference. If they had those million jobs, they would have -- you would have said, "They did a nice job." Not great, by the way, because you're starting from a depression base, you're starting from where these numbers are, where the real numbers are that just got released yesterday.

Also, they wanted to hold these numbers till after because these numbers are worse than the 818,000 fraudulent job numbers, with only 12,000 jobs were created. That's a depression. Listen to this, 30,000 private sector jobs were killed in a single month and nearly 100,000 manufacturing jobs were wiped out since the beginning of the year, 100,000.
