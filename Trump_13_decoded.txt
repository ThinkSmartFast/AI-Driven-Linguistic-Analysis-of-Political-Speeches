[Audio gap] This feels even bigger than Madison Square Garden. This is a lot of people. This is a lot of people. Wow. Thank you very much, Atlanta. It's great to be with you, and a very special hello to Georgia. We love Georgia. And I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state, and that's what it is.
Donald Trump
00:00:41-00:00:58 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.09)
It's an incredible state with, maybe more importantly, incredible people, with thousands of hardworking American patriots. That's what you are. And I will say, these are the largest speakers I've ever seen, over here. I've never seen that. I just feel sorry for the poor people that are sitting over there.
Donald Trump
00:00:58-00:01:28 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.208)
You get your money back, OK? Everybody in this -- Wow. They're doing something a little different here. I've never seen that before. Wow. No, I want to take care of 100 percent, not 99 percent, right? Good. You OK over there? Are you OK? So, I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] I don't think so.
Donald Trump
00:01:28-00:01:53 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.003)
I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote in this election -- Can you imagine, seven days? We -- not me, we will end inflation, we will stop the invasion of criminals coming into our country, and we will bring back the American dream. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring it back.
Donald Trump
00:01:53-00:02:17 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.461)
We're going to bring it back so big and so beautiful. Our country will be bigger. Our country will be better and bolder and richer and safer and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence and failure or whether or not we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.
Donald Trump
00:02:17-00:02:39 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.143)
You know, we're starting from a little bit of a -- we're a little bit of a negative. We're starting with a little bit of a negative. They have 13,099 murderers released into our country. They have [Audience boos] tens of thousands of criminals released. Twenty-one million people released into our country over the last few years.
Donald Trump
00:02:39-00:03:02 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.019)
We have no idea who the hell they are, where they come from. It was open borders policy of Kamala. Not a great policy. Not a wise -- does anybody like the idea of open borders for the world to come in? No? [Audience responds "No"] She loves it. I don't -- honestly, I don't think she likes -- she loves -- she does -- I don't think she has -- I don't think she knows what the hell she's doing.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.546)
With your support on November 5th -- you know who was nasty to me? Michelle Obama. [Audience boos] She was ooh, ooh, ooh. I always tried to be so nice and respectful. Oh, she opened up a little bit of a -- a little bit of a box. She opened up a little bit of something. She was nasty, ooh. Shouldn't be that way.
Donald Trump
00:03:32-00:03:59 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.277)
That was a big mistake that she made. With your support on November 5th, we will achieve success that no one can imagine. We will have the strongest economy, the most secure borders, the safest cities, the most powerful military, the best trade deals. We will dominate the frontiers of science, medicine, business, technology, and space.
Donald Trump
00:03:59-00:04:28 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.472)
And I'm asking you to be -- for the first time in four years to be excited about the future of our country again. Be excited. We're going to turn it around for you. But with that, I say this, our country can't stand another five months of this because we're going to lose it. We're going to lose it. We got to get this thing done.
Donald Trump
00:04:28-00:04:51 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.324)
And I do hear the votes are coming in very nicely. That's what I'm hearing, like to a level that nobody can believe, a level that nobody can believe. And I'm asking you to dream big again, and this will be America's new golden age. We're going to have a golden age. And hard to believe -- after the four years -- almost four years of what we've gone through, it's hard to believe I can even say that.
Donald Trump
00:04:51-00:05:09 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.06)
Some people would say, "He's got to be crazy." No, we're going to have a golden age. It's going to happen fast, too. [Audience member calls out "Thank you"] We are the party of common sense. Remember, we are the party of common sense. You know, conservative. We're not -- who -- we're the party of common sense.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.671)
We don't want transgender operations all over the place. [Audience boos] We don't want open borders. We don't want men playing in women's sports. How is that going to work? [Audience boos] You know, that's a big thing, the men playing -- and yet, I've been doing this for quite a while. I used to say I've never done this before.
Donald Trump
00:05:29-00:05:45 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.93)
I used to get up -- in my first six months, I'd say, "Well, look, I never did this before." You know, I had a good excuse. We have no excuse. But I'll tell you, nobody's ever come up to me and said, "Sir, it's really important to me. Would you do me a favor? Would you let men play in women's sports?" Nobody has ever said it.
Donald Trump
00:05:45-00:06:05 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.201)
They've asked me for a lot of things. They've asked me for better energy prices, lower cost of eggs and salad and everything, anything you can imagine. Nobody's ever said, "Please, sir. It's so important. Please, let men play in women's sports. It's so important." I've never -- and I've never had anybody ask me about the transgender.
Donald Trump
00:06:05-00:06:50 (45 sec)
No StressLens
It's such a big deal, but nobody said, "Could you do us a favor? Could you let it be much easier for men to be able transition -- to transition into women?" Nobody said that to me. Now, I'm sure there's somebody -- but nobody has said it to me. And if -- if really, does anybody here think that we should do that and make it real easy? [Audience responds "No"] And nobody said, "Sir, it's really, really important that we have open borders and we allow criminals from every country in the world to pour into our country, that we allow prisoners and drug dealers and terrorists and human traffickers to pour into our country. Sir, this is very important to us."

No Signal (0.34)
What the hell are these people doing? They're destroying our country. Nobody wants this. I think we're going to get a really big vote. I think we're going to get a lot of Democrats voting for us. You know, one thing, I'll say it to you because, you know, we're almost finished with this campaign. Can you believe it? We've been doing this together for nine years if you think about it, right, for nine years.
Donald Trump
00:07:15-00:07:40 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.165)
We've had the greatest -- look, look, up in the little tiny corners of this big place. We've had the greatest rallies in the history of the world, not just if -- this country. There has never been -- I mean, we filled up Madison Square Garden last night. We could have filled it up 10 times. If you looked outside, you saw the -- all the way back to the Hudson River.
Donald Trump
00:07:40-00:08:00 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.043)
There's never been anything like it. I tell all my people that are working for me, maybe they'll come with us because they did a good job. But the ones that won't, they want to stay in the campaign business. I say it's going to be very tough. And four years from now, you'll have a candidate and you'll have an event and they'll draw 250 people.
Donald Trump
00:08:00-00:08:22 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.463)
That's what normal would be. If the best -- I don't want to use names, but the best politician came here and so-and-so is coming here. I'd love to use a name that everybody loves, like Ronald Reagan. We love Ronald Reagan. I'll use it, anyway. Why not? You'd have 300 or 400 people going to a ballroom someplace, and it would be very acceptable.
Donald Trump
00:08:22-00:08:50 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.542)
You're not going to have 15,000, 20,000 people. It doesn't happen. This is a unique situation. It's a unique point in time. It's Make America Great Again. It's the greatest political movement of all time. [Audience chants "Trump"] But we have a lot of such great people. We have such great people. Thank you. [Audience chants "Trump"]

No Signal (0.23)
Look at this giant -- look at the corners. There are people sitting in the corners. You always know if you're doing well when every little corner with those crummy seats up there, they're gone, too. But every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands. And that's so true.
Donald Trump
00:09:18-00:09:59 (41 sec)
No Signal (0.221)
What a rotten job. She's grossly incompetent. She's more incompetent than Biden, and I didn't think that was possible. Next Tuesday, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had a terrible, terrible run, that you've hurt our country very badly, you've let murderers into our country and drug dealers, you've let human traffickers in, you've let terrorists into our country, you've -- you've accepted people from mental institutions and from jails, you've accepted some of the worst criminals in the world into our country.
Donald Trump
00:09:59-00:10:38 (39 sec)
No StressLens
You're going to say, "Please say it, sir." I say I will. Kamala, you're fired. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. [Audience chants "Lock her up"] Yeah. No, no. [Audience chants "Lock her up"] Be nice, be nice, be nice. You know, they used to say that with Hillary, and I'd always go relax, take it easy, we're going to win.
Donald Trump
00:10:38-00:11:02 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.358)
We're going to win, Brandon. We're going to win, just please relax. They would do it -- every time I'd mention her name, they'd scream, "Lock her up, lock her up." And then the fake news -- that's a lot of fake news. Look at that. [Audience boos] That's a lot. Yeah. That's a lot, Bruce, isn't it, huh? It's a lot of fakers back there.
Donald Trump
00:11:02-00:11:20 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.137)
But no, it's -- you know that's true. I'd say, "Easy. We're going to win. We're going to win." Then we won. And then they really went where they said, "Lock her up, lock her up, lock her up." They'd scream. I'd say, "Easy, easy. We won. We're going to have unity." I could have locked her up, but I didn't want to lock her up.
Donald Trump
00:11:20-00:11:56 (36 sec)
No Signal (0.217)
She's the wife of the president of the United States, previously, and the -- and she was secretary of state. I said that would be so terrible for our country. And then they try and do it to me. [Audience boos] Isn't it terrible? Even in this area, you have Fani [Audience boos] F-A-N-I Willis. I -- I don't even know what it's all about.
Donald Trump
00:11:56-00:12:21 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.017)
A lot of the people -- they hurt a lot of people, good people, Fani and her boyfriend, whatever the hell his name is, Wade. He was an expert on this. He was a -- "Did you have any communication with the White --" "No, no, no, no, I had none." Turned out he was there many days, many days, coordinating with Justice -- I call it coordinating with the Injustice Department.
Donald Trump
00:12:21-00:12:37 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.99)
No, I thought it would have looked terrible to take Hillary Clinton. Could have locked her up. She did so many bad things. But wouldn't that be -- wouldn't that be terrible? Then I come into office, and we did it all right, too. We did it right. We didn't do anything wrong. We didn't do anything wrong.
Donald Trump
00:12:37-00:13:03 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.565)
I'm just -- they went after their political opponent. They went after their political opponent and they made me more popular. Can you believe it? They made me more popular. I've been investigated more than the late great Alphonse Capone. This was not a nice person. He would take that tough guy to dinner right there.
Donald Trump
00:13:03-00:13:28 (25 sec)
No StressLens
He's a tough guy. I know him. He'd take him to dinner. If Alphonse didn't like him, he was gone. He'd be in the foundation of a building somewhere. They'd never find him. They'd never find him. And Al Capone wasn't investigated as much as me. How about my family? I have the greatest family, and they're constantly getting subpoenaed, constantly.

No Signal (0.114)
Eric Trump, he's the king. He's the king. He's a good kid. He's an innocent kid. He gets a subpoena every day. Nancy Pelosi, a total thief. Think of it. She has -- I think it was Visa, wasn't it, Marjorie, Visa stock? She owns a lot of Visa stock. She started off with nothing. He had nothing, too. She started -- now, she's worth like $200 million or something. [Audience member calls out "Lock them up"]

No Signal (0.47)
[Audience boos] I'm always proud to say that I lost a hell of a lot of money doing this, but I'm proud to do it because I would not even think about it. This is the greatest -- and we're going to make the country great again. That's so -- I got so many people. They're rich. Who the hell cares? I'm rich as hell.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.358)
I don't give a damn. I lost -- I lost billions, billions. But think of this. Oh, the things I could have done. I could have made deals. I just don't want to do it. You know, it's such an honor to be president. I don't care if it costs you a couple of billion bucks. More than that. But think of this, she's got a big position in Visa.
Donald Trump
00:14:26-00:14:58 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.081)
I don't know much about Visa, but she sold her position. That was OK, except the following day, they announced that Visa is going to be indicted or something bad is going to happen to them by the Department of Justice. Does anything happen? Nothing happens. They sold a day before the news came out, and she walked away, and then the stock, I assume, went down like a rock, right? What a disgraceful -- and then she sits back, oh, we're going to this or that.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.363)
He's not a perfect -- he's not a great American. Let me tell you. We are great Americans. The people in this room are great Americans. This man right here is a great American. We got a lot of great Americans in this room. [Audience chants "USA"] Early voting is underway in Georgia until November 1st.

No Signal (0.145)
And boy, do I hear we're doing good. But I can't look. I don't want to say it because I want you to keep going. We got to finish it off. You know, it's like I see these guys in a baseball game, they're going to win, and they get nice and complacent, and then they get their ass kicked in the last inning. [Audience chants "USA"]

I see the golfers walking down with a comfortable lead, and he said, "Oh, this is an easy game. This is so easy." And then he hits one out of bounds, he hits another one out of bounds, and he ends up losing a turn. We can't do that. We've just got to focus. Everybody, get out. Could I ask -- could I take a free poll? You know, pollsters charge you a lot of money for this stuff for nothing.
Donald Trump
00:15:54-00:16:19 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.221)
I'm not even sure they actually go and interview anybody. I think they said, "We interviewed 2,000 people." They probably didn't, but these are minor details. But I never complained when we're leading. And we're leading now in all the polls, so I can't complain. But -- but let me do a free poll. Let me do a free poll, Burt.
Donald Trump
00:16:19-00:16:43 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.11)
I want to do a free poll, Burt. So, who has voted already? OK. Don't be embarrassed. Who has not voted yet but will? It's very interesting. So, you have a lot of early voters and you have a lot -- because we have a 50-50. So, the rest of you, you have to get out and vote. We're leading by a lot but get out and vote.
Donald Trump
00:16:43-00:17:08 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.242)
We can't take any chances, right? The most important thing you can do. We're going to make our country great again. We're going to make America great again, but get out and vote. With your help, eight days from now, we're going to defeat Kamala. You know, she's not a nice person. Does anybody know that? She is not a nice person in case you had any ideas.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.373)
Did you see she used the F word the other day? She thought she was talking without a camera on, she used the F word. [Audience boos] Did you see that? Oh, it's terrible. If that ever happened to me, you would -- -- it would have been front-page headlines. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. No, they got her using the wrong word on camera.
Donald Trump
00:17:28-00:17:54 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.176)
She should be admonished for doing that. Don't you agree? How about when her teleprompter clogged up on her? You know, it happens a lot. She was saying there are 32 days left, right? You know, she was -- well, right now, there's seven days left. Can you believe it? So, a few weeks ago, she had her teleprompter going blazing because she can't talk without a teleprompter.
Donald Trump
00:17:54-00:18:26 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.403)
So, she's up there and she got "There are 32 --" It stopped. I knew immediately. It stopped. "There are 32 -- 32 --" She was gone. "Thirty --" She said, like, five times, "32." Boom. Then it kicked in. Oh, did she get lucky? She got so lucky. But we're going to win back that beautiful White House and we are going to, indeed, make America great again.

No Signal (0.035)
We're going to do it fast, too. And I'm running a campaign of solutions to save our country. Kamala is running a campaign of demonization and hate. She really does. She's a hater. She's a hater. She was a lousy attorney general. She was a lousy DA, horrible DA. She used to prosecute Republicans. She went after Republicans all the time.
Donald Trump
00:19:01-00:19:23 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.606)
I know the feeling. But she used to go after Republicans. I had a friend who had a terrible thing happen to him and family member. Horrible thing. She went in and he went in. And having to do with their daughter, they went in to see her when she was, I think, the attorney general or DA, but I think the attorney general.
Donald Trump
00:19:23-00:19:52 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.517)
And it was very serious, a very serious crime was committed. When she heard that he was a Republican, she refused to see him. The meeting was all set up, then she heard he was a Republican and she said, "I'm not seeing him." It's a disgrace. That guy hates her beyond anybody that I've ever seen. Remember when [Audience boos] crooked Hillary called Americans deplorable and irredeemable? [Audience boos] You know, I watched that speech.
Donald Trump
00:19:52-00:20:16 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.271)
I said, "That's pretty bad." I thought -- but I thought the irredeemable was worse than the deplorable. When they said -- she said deplorable and irredeemable, think about -- deplorable is bad. But irredeemable, isn't it worse, Mr. Senator? Brandon, you're the greatest. Think of that, irredeemable. So, I said, "Man, she could be in trouble."
Donald Trump
00:20:16-00:20:34 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.385)
It turned out it was the opposite, deplorable. I didn't care. But deplorable was bad. Remember that? And all of a sudden, everybody is showing up, I am deplorable, everyone. That was not, Marjorie, a great statement that she made regarding -- I didn't think it was going to blow up like that. You know, it was -- that's why it's a very dangerous business.
Donald Trump
00:20:34-00:21:07 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.107)
One word misspoken at a rally -- and I don't use a teleprompter much, which I think you respect, frankly. Because if I did -- because if I did, you'd be bored stiff. You'd be walking out of here by now. You'd say, "Oh, this is pretty boring." But it's fraught with danger, when you don't use a -- because one word and your political career is over, one little word misplaced, one little anything.
Donald Trump
00:21:07-00:21:38 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.051)
Think of it. And isn't it great to have a guy that doesn't need to look at a teleprompter at all, right? I don't need to. But that's why I say with Kamala, she can't make it without a -- even with the teleprompter, she's no good. But she can't make it without a teleprompter. And if you're going to be in this business, 5 percent -- I was telling somebody the other night, the other night, 5 percent of the time, teleprompters break.
Donald Trump
00:21:38-00:21:51 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.176)
And outside, they're really bad. They blow off the stage. Rain hits them and they blow up. A lot of bad things. So, if you're going to run for office, make sure you don't mind not using a teleprompter because you're going to have a lot of times when they're not there. And that's what I'm waiting for.
Donald Trump
00:21:51-00:22:20 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.303)
I'm waiting to see her not have the use of a teleprompter because it's -- but I hope it's going to be over very soon. I really do. I hope -- and then I'm going to wish her well. I'm going to wish her well and hope we -- we can say goodbye to her radical left lunatic policies. Kamala is now doing something much worse than what she was talking about.

No Signal (0.344)
The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that everyone who isn't voting for her is a Nazi. We're Nazis. [Audience boos] You know, years ago, my father -- I had a great father. He's a tough guy. He used to always say, "Never use the word Nazi. Never use that word." And he'd say, "Never use the word Hitler. Don't use that word."
Donald Trump
00:22:44-00:23:13 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.327)
It's like -- I don't even know why. Don't use that word. And then I understood it. And yet, they used that word freely, both words. They use it. "He's Hitler." And then they say, "He's a Nazi." I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi. I don't know. It's true. My father always used to tell me, "Don't use the word -- you don't use -- ever use the word Nazi."

No Signal (0.045)
And, you know, it's incredible. Now, the way they talk is so disgusting and just -- just horrible, the way they talk. And they -- they don't mean it even. They just want to do -- you know, they think that they can say -- they've called me everything from a mad genius looking to take over the world to a very, very stupid person.
Donald Trump
00:23:34-00:24:04 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.499)
I've covered from stupid to mad genius that will eventually succeed in taking over the world. No, these are bad people. They've -- they've covered everything. Let's see, last week, oh, that -- last week, "Oh, he's tired." You know what I mean? I've done this stuff now for 58 days in a row, and I don't even feel tired a little bit.
Donald Trump
00:24:04-00:24:19 (15 sec)
No Signal (0.464)
Not even a little bit. [Applause] And the thing that bothered me is she said it as she's taking yet another day off, you know. I said, "You know, she's taking a day off." Like, a couple of days ago, she took like two days off in a row. And I said, "You know, you're running for something that's so important."
Donald Trump
00:24:19-00:24:39 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.549)
And in terms of importance, it's like Super Bowl times 100, right? Super Bowl maybe times a thousand. You don't take days off. You go every single day. No, I'm not tired. And they knew I wasn't tired. If I was tired, I'd tell you, "I'm very tired." There may be a time when I'll say that. But, you know, they said that.

We won two world wars, we won everything, but they're not going woke. Our people are not. I know them very well. We defeated ISIS, and we did it in record time, a few number of weeks. They said it was going to take five years. We did it in weeks. They're not going anywhere. In conclusion, with your vote this November, we're going to fire Kamala and we're going to save America.

We will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to Georgia. We will build America, and we will buy American, and we will hire American. I will end the war in Ukraine. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East. And I will prevent World War III from happening.

We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect they so dearly deserve. We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield, all of it made in the USA with a lot made right here. We will rebuild our cities, including our capitol in Washington, DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again.

We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. And we will keep men out of women's sports. I will defend religious liberty. I will restore free speech.

And I will defend the right to keep and bear arms. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country, defend our borders, and protect our citizens. And I will stop illegal immigration once and for all. We will not be invaded.

We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We're not going to be overrun by anybody. We will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again.

But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig. And that's where we are right now. So, you need to get out and vote. For the past nine years, we have been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces on Earth. With your vote this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them.
