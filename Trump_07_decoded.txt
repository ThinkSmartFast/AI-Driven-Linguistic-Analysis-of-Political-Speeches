Donald Trump Holds a Campaign Rally in Tempe, Arizona - October 24, 2024

Donald Trump
00:00:00-00:00:29 (29 sec)
Weak (1.036)
Well, thank you very much, and a very special hello to Arizona. Thank you very much. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of very, very hardworking American patriots. Thank you very much, everybody. So, as you know, early voting, we're finally here. We're just -- oh, we can't take this any longer.
Donald Trump
00:00:29-00:00:46 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.176)
We don't like incompetent people, do we? We don't like incompetent. These people are grossly incompetent. They're going to be changed. We have no choice. We have to change them, and we have to change them on November 5th -- going to be the most important day in the history of our country. I believe that, too.
Donald Trump
00:00:46-00:01:17 (31 sec)
Weak (1.221)
Early voting is underway here in Arizona, and we're doing great in Arizona. I don't know if you've been hearing, they got a problem. They got a problem. We've got to make it too big to rig. Too big to rig, right? But if you want, vote by mail tomorrow. It's your last day to request a ballot, but you can cast your early vote in person all the way through November 1st.
Donald Trump
00:01:17-00:01:43 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.806)
Or you can vote on Election Day, which is to -- just get out and vote. You got to go vote. We got to save it. We have a -- we call it a nation in decline. We're being nice when we say that. With your help, 12 days from now, we're going to win Arizona. We're going to defeat Kamala Harris. [Applause] And we're going to make America great again.
Donald Trump
00:01:43-00:02:12 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.904)
That's what we're going to do. Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has eradicated our sovereign border, and she has unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens.
Donald Trump
00:02:12-00:02:39 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.565)
And my message today is very simple: Kamala's migrant invasion given to us through gross incompetence disqualifies her from even thinking about being president. We can't let that happen. No person who is responsible for so much bloodshed and death on our soil can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States.
Donald Trump
00:02:39-00:02:59 (20 sec)
Weak (1.225)
What she's done and he's done -- Crooked Joe and Kamala, what a combination. Worst combination in the history of our country. And they've weaponized your government. They're a disgrace to our country. Four years ago, we had the strongest, safest, and most secure border in US history with the lowest level of illegal immigration ever achieved.
Donald Trump
00:02:59-00:03:45 (45 sec)
No StressLens
Four years ago. Put up the chart. Go ahead, put it up. My favorite chart. [Applause] That was the lowest -- that was the day I left office. We -- we did great in 2016. We got millions more votes in 2020, but that's the way it goes. But this is our big -- this is bigger than anything. This is going to be the biggest and most important election ever.
Donald Trump
00:03:45-00:04:19 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.053)
It's going to be the biggest political event, I believe, in our country's history. We have to win, and we don't need it for the big political event. We need it to save our country. When Kamala came in, she deliberately dismantled our border and threw open the gates -- she threw them open -- the gates to an invasion of criminal migrants from prisons and jails from insane asylums and mental institutions from all over the world, from Venezuela to the Congo in Africa.
Donald Trump
00:04:19-00:04:44 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.094)
A lot of people coming out of the Congo, not just South America. They're coming from 181 countries as of yesterday right in -- we're a dumping ground. We're like a -- we're like a garbage can for the world. That's what's happened. That's what's happened to her. We're like a garbage can. You know, it's the first time I've ever said that.
Donald Trump
00:04:44-00:05:06 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.32)
And every time I come up and talk about what they've done to our country, I get angrier and angrier. First time I've ever said garbage can. But you know what, it's a very accurate description. Meanwhile, she cruelly forced our border agents to help facilitate her wicked betrayal of America. And by the way, the Border Patrol, last week, gave us their complete and total endorsement, and they said she is the worst. [Applause]
Donald Trump
00:05:06-00:05:34 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.916)
I want to thank them. And they -- at the same time, they said she is so bad. She's the worst. You can't have her. And they don't want to do that. It's probably not easy for them to do that. But you know what, they said she's horrible. She was the border czar, and she never made one phone call. Not only didn't she come to the border, she never made a phone call.
Donald Trump
00:05:34-00:05:56 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.334)
And now, a few months ago when her -- she was getting killed, both of them, him and her, they were getting killed. They made it a little bit tougher, but they forgot to stop the airplanes going overhead. We said, "How come those planes are still flying?" Hundreds of thousands of people flown into our country, landing in our beautiful Midwest and other places.
Donald Trump
00:05:56-00:06:20 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.066)
And they're devastated. You know what's happening to Springfield, Ohio and Aurora and Colorado. What they're doing to our country -- we are joined today by the former senior Border Patrol chief of the San Diego sector, Aaron Heitke, an eyewitness to one of the most horrific scandals in American history carried out by Kamala.
Donald Trump
00:06:20-00:06:48 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.342)
Well, she was appointed by this guy because he has to go to sleep every night at 4 o'clock. And she was appointed by him. And therefore, she was the border czar, but she doesn't want to be called -- so, who cares what she is? She was appointed to take care of our border. We had the worst border. And now -- and by the way, she also destroyed San Francisco, one of the greatest cities in the world 15, 16 years ago.
Donald Trump
00:06:48-00:07:31 (43 sec)
No StressLens
And California, when she was attorney general, a disaster between her and Gavin Newscum, is the worst. [Audience boos] But it's deadly. What they've done is deadly. The open border policy is a disaster. Aaron, please come up and say a few words. Border Patrol. [Applause] Thank you.
Aaron Heitke
00:07:31-00:07:39 (9 sec)
No StressLens
I've never seen anything worse than the last four years that I've seen under the current administration. I had the pleasure of working for President Trump --
Donald Trump

No StressLens
That's right.
Aaron Heitke
00:07:40-00:08:14 (33 sec)
No StressLens
And things were never better. I had the misfortune of spending the last four years watching our border be overrun. It's been nonstop. The agents' morale has been destroyed. It's been -- it's been very difficult to watch. I testified in front of the Senate recently to get the word out. The public doesn't know, this administration has continued to say there's no threat at the border.
Aaron Heitke
00:08:14-00:08:22 (8 sec)
No StressLens
We have a continuous threat, a serious threat at the border, that needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed now. Thank you, sir. [Applause]
Donald Trump
00:08:22-00:08:48 (26 sec)
Weak (1.183)
Thank you, Aaron. And that's heartfelt, too. That's heartfelt. He just wants it to be straightened out along with the border. They're incredible people. Getting their endorsement was my great honor, but it says something. And we had unanimous -- thousands of people, unanimous. Who could ever get that? Because she's so bad.
Donald Trump
00:08:48-00:09:19 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.996)
She's so bad. She's -- I watched last night. I don't watch CNN often. It's fake news, but I watched last night. Now, they're -- they -- oops, their camera just went off. I watched last night, she did a town hall. Honestly, it was pathetic. It was pathetic. There's never been anything like that. We can't let it happen.
Donald Trump
00:09:19-00:09:46 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.094)
We can't -- that's why you have to get everyone saying how well we're doing, you still get out the people that haven't voted. Get out and vote. We can't take a chance. We can't take a chance on this disaster continuing because we won't have a country left if it does. The four-year long nightmare that Kamala Harris has forced your men to endure -- your men, your women, your children, it's a -- it's a nightmare for the whole planet, if you want to know the truth.
Donald Trump
00:09:46-00:10:09 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.21)
Because we represent so much. We represent the American dream. The whole world is watching us, and they see these people that -- that don't deserve to be in any position of authority. Remember, he got -- whether you like him or not -- I'm not a fan of his. Did you see last night? He blew it. He said, "Lock him up."
Donald Trump
00:10:09-00:10:39 (30 sec)
Weak (1.242)
He would -- he said, "Lock him up" last night. He's not allowed to say that. He's such a stupid guy. Such a stupid fool. He's such a guy. What a -- but they actually -- remember, this -- this was the -- they took it away from him. They did something that's never happened. You know, you can use different words, but they just took away the presidency of the United States.
Donald Trump
00:10:39-00:10:55 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.537)
And they wanted to be politically correct. They gave it to her, and she was last. She was the first one out, and she came in. Out of the Top 13 contenders, she came in last, and they gave her the -- she had no votes. He got 14 million, whether you like this guy or not. And not too many people are thrilled.
Donald Trump
00:10:55-00:11:13 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.307)
And, you know, if you remember, we had a debate. And debate -- he didn't do great in the debate, but you know what, that's what happens. And he went down, and he was not doing great. But you got to let him ride it out, right? Instead, they took him out. They said, "You're coming out. We're not going to let you..."
Donald Trump
00:11:13-00:11:39 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.793)
They tell this to the president. This is Crazy Nancy. She's crazy as a bedbug, that one. She's a nutjob who's crooked as hell. Listen, she started off with nothing. Two weeks ago, a company that was going to be investigated -- the following day, she had a lot of stock in the company. She sold the stock the day before they announced the investigation of the company.
Donald Trump
00:11:39-00:12:02 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.515)
That's Crazy Nancy. [Audience boos] No, I think she's immune from investigation. Can you -- can you believe? I think she's immune. But -- not a good person. So, when I win on November 5th, the migrate -- and remember this: We're going to win. I think we're going to win, maybe bigger than anyone understands. [Applause]
Donald Trump
00:12:02-00:12:36 (34 sec)
Medium (1.803)
You have to get out and vote. And when I win on November 5th -- and it's not me. We win. We're going to win. When we win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. We're going to restore our country. One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country -- essentially, she -- open borders.
Donald Trump
00:12:36-00:12:57 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.22)
When you say open borders -- and then they say, "We're going to give you health care, education. We're going to give..." They're forced to come up, right? Sheriff, you look good. Handsome guy. But they -- they come in. It's like a magnet. They come in. They promised everything. They -- in New York, they get hotel rooms, luxury hotel rooms.
Donald Trump
00:12:57-00:13:25 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.566)
And our veterans are forced to sleep on the streets. Think of it. [Audience boos] But as the savage Venezuela prison gang formed in the prison, Tren de Aragua, that is taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent terror spree -- this is in -- in that case, in Colorado. And the governor, who is a radical-left Democrat, is petrified of the situation.
Donald Trump
00:13:25-00:13:46 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.005)
He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what to do. Replace him. I think we replace him. I think -- I hope Colorado -- you know, Colorado with the governor, this weak guy -- Colorado was the one that tried to get Trump. I'm leading every candidate, including the Democrats, on the ballot, and they put in a petition to have me removed from the ballot.
Donald Trump
00:13:46-00:14:10 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.883)
And then they say -- think of it. They didn't get very far, but this guy tried that. So -- and then they say I'm a threat to democracy. I'm a threat? No, they're a threat. But they even are taking over parts of Times Square. They're all over the place now, and they have weapons like very few people have. So, let's take a look.

Not even believable, 13,099 illegal alien convicted murderers were set to prey upon the United States of America. Think of that.

We have them all, the worst murderers in the world. They make our criminals look like nice people, I'm telling you. The cartels' profits have soared from $500 million a year under Trump to $13 billion under the border czar, Kamala. And every day, they're stealing innocent lives on both sides of the border.

They're the enemy of the -- I've been asked not to say it. I don't want to say it. They're the enemy of the people. And someday, they're not going to be the enemy of the people, I hope. Just days ago, a young US Marine Corps veteran named Nicholas Quets from right here in Arizona -- you know about it -- was driving through Mexico for a beach weekend, just a weekend with his friends -- a really good -- good guy, good kid -- when he was viciously gunned down on the highway and murdered by members of a Mexican cartel.

They're tough, and they love the country. But think of this: two young girls walking to school, 16 years old. They don't like using guns because knives are more painful. They sliced them up into pieces, kill them both, and then went about playing and doing whatever the hell they were doing. And ICE went in and grabbed them and got them.

And nowadays, everything's so politically correct. They fight harder for the criminal than they do for the people that have been murdered, killed. These stupid politicians. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 -- can you believe that -- to go back that far -- to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.
Donald Trump

Can you imagine having to go back to 1798? And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. [Applause] [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you.
Donald Trump
00:24:46-00:25:23 (37 sec)

I will end catch and release. You know we had a policy called Remain in Mexico. People think that was easier to get. That was so good. They ended it immediately. I will end all migrant flights. I will outlaw sanctuary cities, which is a place where they give criminals sanctuary. I will immediately ask Congress for funding to hire 10,000 new border agents and to approve a 10 percent raise for existing agents and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus.

We're doing it. They've been treated unfairly. And I will ban all welfare and federal benefits from illegal aliens, and they won't come anymore. They won't come.
