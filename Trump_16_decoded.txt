Weak (1.212)
Thank you. Wow. Well, thank you very much, North Carolina. You are a special group of people. In fact, my beautiful little grandchild, the most beautiful little girl you've ever seen, is named Carolina. Do you know that? It's true. I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots.
Donald Trump
00:00:36-00:00:47 (11 sec)
No Signal (0.48)
But I'd like to ask you one very simple, easy-to-answer question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"]
Donald Trump
00:00:47-00:01:20 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.277)
I don't think so. I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans with your vote in this election. Oh, it's coming up. So nice, we're down to six days, maybe sort of five. Maybe five, the way you count it. Six days, can you imagine, I will end inflation, I will stop the massive invasion of criminals into our country, and I will bring back a thing called the American Dream.
Donald Trump
00:01:20-00:01:45 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.143)
Isn't that nice? Because we haven't had that. We haven't had that in a long time. Our country will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. And this election is a choice between whether we'll have a -- four more years. Think of this, four more years of gross incompetence, the most corrupt, horrible people.
Donald Trump
00:01:45-00:02:04 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.298)
These are horrible people. Oops, we should get along with everybody. They're horrible people. You know, some people you just can't get along with. You can't. But whether we're going to have four years of incompetence and failure or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country, that's what's going to happen.
Donald Trump
00:02:04-00:02:29 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.761)
And I'm asking you to be excited about the future. Again, you have to be excited about -- we have a great potential. If we have to go another two days beyond that term, we're not going to have a great -- we have to get this done now because we're not going to have a second chance. There will never be a be -- there'll never be a second chance.
Donald Trump
00:02:29-00:02:54 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.171)
It's too far gone. We're really -- you know, we are a failing nation. We are a nation in decline, but don't worry. We will not be a nation in decline for too much longer, I'll tell you. We'll be a nation of incline as opposed to decline, but I'm asking you to dream big again. You're going to have to dream big again.
Donald Trump
00:02:54-00:03:17 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.616)
It's going to be hard for you to do that because you've gone through a long period, but we had some great four years. This will be America's new golden age. This will be better than what we had even four years ago. Remember, we were energy-independent. We had everything. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now, the fate of our nation is in your hands.
Donald Trump
00:03:17-00:03:44 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.722)
And this is a very important state. Number one, I love the state. Number two, we've always won. I won the primaries, and I won the elections. And I didn't have to worry about it. [Applause] So, you know, if you think, 2016, we did great. 2020, we did much better actually, you know? They say, "Oh, he's a conspiracy theorist."
Donald Trump
00:03:44-00:04:08 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.446)
We only got about, what, 12 million more votes, right? But this is the best of all. This is -- there's more enthusiasm than there was for even 2016 or 2020. This is the -- the best. Nobody's ever seen it. [Applause] I just saw General Kellogg wherever he may be backstage. Where is he? Oh, there he -- look at that general.
Donald Trump
00:04:08-00:04:28 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.618)
He's a real general, not like Milley -- not like Milley. Not like Kelly, low -- he's a low-IQ guy, but he is a -- this is a real general. He's great. But he said backstage, "Just reminds me, sir, of 2016." I said, "Thank you very much." That's a good -- that's a good reminder, isn't it? He's a great guy.

This Tuesday, you have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough, that you're not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here, Kamala -- the hell out of here. The worst vice president, the worst border czar. She's the worst border czar in the history of the world -- has never been a border in the history of the world that allowed criminals to pour through.
Donald Trump
00:04:58-00:05:27 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.326)
Twenty-one million people, think of it. Well, we're running a campaign of solutions to save America, an America which they have virtually destroyed during their almost-four-year period of rule. Kamala Harris, a low-IQ individual, is running a campaign of hate, anger, and retribution. See, I'm very nice to them.
Donald Trump
00:05:27-00:06:00 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.971)
They're not nice to me. She spends all of her time complaining about everything but does nothing about it. She's going to do this; she's going to do that. Why the hell didn't she do it, right? [Applause] So, now, she's talking about what she's going to do on the border. Well, I'm going to do this and that and this and that.
Donald Trump
00:06:00-00:06:29 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.568)
All they had to do was leave the border alone. We had the safest border in the history of our country. In fact, to prove it, put up my chart, the favorite chart. I love that chart. I love that chart. That was the day I left office. We had the lowest number ever. The day I left office was where the red arrow is on the bottom.
Donald Trump
00:06:29-00:06:46 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.13)
And then it became like an Elon Musk rocket ship, right? Look at that. Look what happens to it. Right after that, it went to hell. They let it go to hell. We had Remain in Mexico. You couldn't come into our country. You had to remain -- you think that was easy to get from Mexico? I had to be very threatening.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.506)
I said, "You're not going to do it?" "No, sir, we're not. Why would we do that?" I said, "Because if you don't do it, I'm going to put a 100 percent tariff on your cars coming in." "Sir..." True. Took me about one minute. They went from "We will absolutely not do that, sir. Why would we do a thing like that -- Remain in Mexico -- they have to remain in your -- I said, "No, no.
Donald Trump
00:07:10-00:07:33 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.173)
I'll tell you why." You know why? They went from that to saying, "Sir, we would be delighted to do whatever you like." Whatever you -- I said we're going to put 100 percent tariff on your cars if you don't do it. So, they said we'd love to have our people have -- we would love to have MS-13 gang members, criminals, people from mental institutions stay in our country. "
Donald Trump

No StressLens
It would be our great honor, sir." It was really amazing. It took less than a minute. But -- or what she's going to do about inflation. "I'm going to do things about..." She caused the inflation by screwing up my energy policies. She caused the inflation and spending way too much money on the green new scam. She caused it. But why didn't she do something about it, right? Or what she's going to do to get the economy going. We're going to do this and that. By the way, her plans are the plans of a simpleton. They're not going to work. We'll be in a depression like 1929. "
Donald Trump
00:08:16-00:08:28 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.695)
What we're going to do to get the economy..." But why didn't she do it? Why didn't she do all these things? She's saying we're going to do this. She's trying to disassociate herself from Sleepy Joe Biden. [Audience member calls out "She's an idiot"]
Donald Trump
00:08:28-00:09:02 (33 sec)
Weak (1.353)
I like this audience. I didn't say it. Well, the guy said, "Who just said that?" He can handle himself. He screams, "She's an idiot." But I didn't say it. I didn't say it. In fact, I'd like to admonish you. Sir, you should not say that, please. This way, the press can't get me. You know, they say, well, I know you want -- it's really good.
Donald Trump
00:09:02-00:09:35 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.235)
Well, no, I don't -- I don't accept that, sir. I would never accept a thing like that, no. But she is -- he can handle himself, that guy, too. She and Crooked Joe head up the worst administration in the history of our country. They've made Jimmy Carter look like a truly great president. In all fairness to Jimmy, he didn't let 21 million people, many of them criminals and those that are mentally ill pour into our country.
Donald Trump
00:09:35-00:10:25 (51 sec)
No StressLens
He didn't let -- Jimmy Carter didn't allow that to happen. Last night, Kamala made a speech -- not much of one -- with a paid-for audience, and all she talked about was Donald Trump.

Do you believe it? [Audience chants "Trump"] Because she and Joe have no achievements, only failure and gloom. See, that was so perfect. It worked out perfectly. I said, "How am I going to say..." Normally you'd stop, and you'd say, "Please take a look at the video." But I have some very talented people.
Donald Trump

Weak (1.123)
I say -- when I say Donald Trump, you just let that go. They did a good job. And then I finished the sentence because they have no achievements -- because they have no -- because they're a disaster. She suffers from a very serious disease known as Trump derangement syndrome. Trump derangement syndrome.

TDS. Sometimes referred to as TDS. It's quite serious. It's inflicted havoc on some lives. But many Democrats suffer from that disease, and it's only because of one reason: because we're winning. Because we're winning. [Applause] This week, Kamala has been comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history.

And now, speaking on a call for her campaign last night, Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters. He called them garbage. [Audience boos] And they mean it, even though, without question, my supporters are far higher quality than Crooked Joe or Lying Kamala. [Applause] My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: You can't lead America if you don't love Americans.
Donald Trump
00:12:17-00:12:45 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.917)
You just can't. And you can't be president if you hate the American people. And there's a lot of hatred there. Kamala Harris is not fit to be president of the United States. She doesn't have the intellect, the stamina, or that special quality that real leaders must have to lead. We know what that is.
Donald Trump
00:12:45-00:13:13 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.292)
It's a special quality. Joe Biden's comments were the direct result of Kamala's and Tim Walz's. You know -- you know who that is? His decision to portray everyone who isn't voting for them as evil or subhuman -- you're not subhuman. I'm looking at you. You are not subhuman. And we know it's what they believe because look how they've treated you.
Donald Trump
00:13:13-00:13:33 (19 sec)
No Signal (0.253)
They've treated you like garbage, frankly. They've treated you like garbage. You know what, the truth is, they've treated our whole country like garbage, whether they meant to or not, because they're grossly incompetent people. And they've destroyed our country. Our country is suffering right now like it's never suffered with inflation.
Donald Trump
00:13:33-00:13:57 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.27)
And with the infliction -- think of it, they've allowed millions and millions of people to come into our country that are criminals, that are the highest level criminals. Thirteen thousand and ninety-nine -- Border Patrol, which endorsed me, by the way, very strongly. [Applause] And it wasn't like I had any competition.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.209)
Thirteen thousand and ninety-nine murderers, many of them murdered more than one person. Thirteen -- this comes -- these are the numbers from Border Patrol during their term. Thirteen thousand and ninety-nine murderers were let into our country. You have drug lords, you have terrorists, you have people from mental institutions, they're all let into our country, and I actually feel it's number two or number three on the list of things.
Donald Trump
00:14:25-00:14:47 (22 sec)
No Signal (0.032)
Number one is the economy, number two is inflation, number three is what they've done to our border, what they've done to our country. They call it immigration. It's not immigration. It's horrible. It's horrible. And I think that it's -- frankly, should be number one on the list. I think inflation is terrible.
Donald Trump
00:14:47-00:15:11 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.726)
What they've done with inflation is gross incompetence, but when they allow 21 million people -- and it's probably much more. That doesn't even include the gotaways. You know, gotaways, these are people that just run across the border. What they've done to our country is -- is never -- there's never -- there's never going to be an excuse for what they've done to this country.

For the past nine years, Kamala and her party have called us racist, bigots, fascists, deplorables, irredeemables, Nazis, and they've called me Hitler. They've called me Hitler.

But, you know, he always used to tell me, "Never use the word Nazi, and never use the word Hitler." Now, we're called Nazis, and I'm called Hitler. I'm not Hitler. Boy, my father, he's looking down. Well, my mother, I know she's looking down. My father is a little questionable because he's -- he was a little rough.
Donald Trump

I think he's looking down because he was a good guy. He was a strong guy, but he was a good guy. But he's looking down. He said, "Can you imagine, that's what they're calling my son. I told him for years, literally, never use the term Nazi or Hitler." Now, they're using it on us; it's unbelievable. They've bullied you.

No Signal (0.752)
They've demeaned us. They've demonized us and censored us and de-platformed us and weaponized the power of our own government against us. They've gone after their political opponent, me. It's unbelievable. Did you see, "Donald Trump wants to put us in jail. Donald Trump is going to go after some of the scum that you see back there."
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.289)
That you see back there that's so dishonest. "Donald Trump is doing horrible things. He wants to put us in prison." That's what they've been trying to do to me for three years. They got the story mixed up. And we won the big case in Florida already. And we're doing very well. We're doing very well. Remember, "Oh, we got him in Florida."
Donald Trump
00:16:56-00:17:32 (36 sec)
No Signal (0.285)
That was the documents case, and I had the Presidential Records Act and lots of other things. But Joe Biden had the same case, except times 10, because he took it out when he wasn't president. He did a lot of things, and they found him guilty. But they let him go because he was mentally incompetent. But they said he could be president.
Donald Trump
00:17:32-00:17:56 (24 sec)
No Signal (0.504)
So, they said he can't stand trial, he's mentally incompetent, he's got no memory, and he's just got it. He just doesn't have what it takes, OK? But think of this, here's the ruling. He can't stand trial because he's mentally incompetent, but he can be the president of the United States. Figure that one out.

No Signal (0.338)
Mr. Congressman, figure that one out, Hudson. Can you imagine? They have taken your money. They've thrown open your borders to criminals and terrorists. They've flooded your towns with deadly drugs and death. They've given your jobs to illegal migrants and sent our blood and treasure to fight really stupid foreign wars, countries that you've never heard of, countries that you and your children have never even heard of.

Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of our country. And his partner -- now, she's trying to convince everyone, "Oh, well, I really had nothing to do with anything, you know." I'm sure he loves hearing that. She is the worst vice president in the history of our country. By the way, if you go back a few months, everybody was saying she's the worst vice president.
Donald Trump

No Signal (0.928)
She's incompetent. She's a dope. She's everything you could imagine. All of a sudden, they decided they better get politically correct, OK? And they chose her over 12 people that are far more competent. We can declare once and for all that we are done with their hatred; we are done with their hysteria; we are done with their hoaxing, lying, cheating, scheming, plundering, and stealing. [Applause]

No, Obama was a great divider. He was a great, great divider. What we have built is the biggest, broadest, most incredible coalition, and the greatest political movement in American history -- I think in any history, if you want to know the truth.

They want one thing: to make America great again. That's all they want. Right? Our campaign has been endorsed by the 400,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police. And I don't believe there's a police organization in America that hasn't endorsed us. And I don't believe there's even a single policeman or policewoman, a cop -- that's another thing.

My father always used to say, "Never call them cops. That's disrespectful." I don't know. I -- I think -- look, I'm going with my father, so we're going to say policeman or policewoman. "Never call them cops. That's disrespectful, son." I don't know. Makes sense. If my father said it, I'd do it. But think of that, I don't think a single policeman or policewoman has endorsed her.

She was a leader of defund the police. That's hard to get an endorsement. "Yes, I was in charge of defunding the police for 10 years. I'd love to have your endorsement." But then we had the Border Patrol agents who were so incredible. For four years, they haven't called her -- she hasn't called. Think of this, four years -- I said, "Has she ever called? Has Biden ever called?" Sleepy Joe -- no.

No Signal (0.113)
I said, "You don't mean no, you mean -- maybe they haven't called you, but have they called you?" We had the top 10 leaders up. They gave me the best endorsement you've ever heard and the worst statement about her. They said she's grossly incompetent, and then she's supposed to be running. I don't believe -- you know, they say it's like a close race.

I can't believe it's a close race. Not -- not that I -- you know, I just can't believe it. But I said, "Did she ever call you?" "No, sir. Never once." I said, "You mean in almost four years, no?" "She never called, sir." Never once. Nobody. She never called anybody. She was in charge of the border, whether you call her border czar.

She doesn't want that name anymore because it was so bad. She did such a bad job, but she was in charge of the border -- think of this -- and she never called the Border Patrol one time in four years.

Easily if you're a genius; more difficult if you're less than a genius.

Paper ballots would cost eight percent of what you have. Now, I'm hearing all sorts of stories. We're not going to have the result by Tuesday night.

And then they always announce that the Republicans, about 5 million short without fail because I believe that if we had an honest election -- if God came down from on high and God said, I will be -- "I will be the voting tabulator for the day," I believe I would win California because I do great -- I do great with the Hispanics.

There is not a thing that comes to mind. So, maybe the worst thing that we can be talking about, 325,000 children that the press never talks about. Three hundred and twenty-five thousand children have come into our country, and they're now missing. They're going to be dead, or they're going to be sex slaves or slaves of some kind.

Three hundred and twenty-five thousand children, many of them are dead. And she said there's not a thing that comes to mind. You know, they -- they -- just like she's a fraud, she's a total fraud, she's a liar. She even lied about McDonald's, didn't she? Huh? But she's a total liar. They lied about 818,000 jobs that they said we built up over the course of their wonderful management.

It turned out to be a total fraud, and they weren't going to announce that until after the election. But we had a whistleblower that called them in. You remember that just a few months ago, they said 818,000 jobs were created, and there weren't. They're fake jobs, and they were going to release the correct information.

It's been acknowledged that the hurricane rescue effort and rebuilding effort is the worst that we've just about ever seen outside of maybe Katrina. But I think it's worse. There's nobody even here, and the devastation is incredible. And how the hell could you vote for somebody that's in charge of it, right? So, I don't think you're going to vote for Kamala.

Here are the facts. Kamala is a radical-left Marxist, rated even worse than Crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas herself. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of defund the police movement. And anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being president of the United States.

Kamala vowed to abolish ICE, our great heroes of ICE. As California attorney general, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. Would anybody in North Carolina want to give up your guns? Quietly. [Audience responds "No"]

Whoa. Whoa. That could have had an impact on my hearing for the rest of my life. That's not going to be an easy job, is it? No, but that's where she comes from.
