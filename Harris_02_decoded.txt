So, Georgia, it is so good to be back. And I am very clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. [Applause] And you all helped us win in 2020, and we going to do it again in 2024. [Applause] Yes, we will. Yes, we will. [Audience members call out, inaudibly]

Weak (1.228)
As many of you know, before I was elected vice president and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney. [Applause] And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:04:46-00:05:06 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.096)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds  [applause]: predators who abused women  [applause]; fraudsters who ripped off consumers  [applause]; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain  [applause]. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type. [Applause] I know the type. And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career.
Kamala Harris
00:05:06-00:05:22 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.004)
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:05:22-00:06:08 (46 sec)
No StressLens
As a prosecutor, I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:06:08-00:06:18 (10 sec)
No Signal (0.488)
And as an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud  [applause]  34 counts.

So, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week  [applause]  any day of the week, including, for example, on the issue of immigration.
Kamala Harris
00:06:26-00:07:09 (42 sec)
No StressLens
So, I was the attorney general of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.
Kamala Harris
00:07:09-00:07:23 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.106)
Donald Trump  [applause]  Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk  [applause]  or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:07:23-00:07:24 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Where's Quavo? [Laughs]
Kamala Harris
00:07:24-00:07:53 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.736)
So, look, our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:07:53-00:07:54 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Right.
Kamala Harris
00:07:54-00:08:07 (13 sec)

Kamala Harris
00:08:07-00:08:19 (12 sec)
Weak (1.391)
 which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:08:19-00:08:22 (3 sec)
No StressLens
And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:08:22-00:09:01 (38 sec)
Weak (1.262)
So, here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law  [applause]  and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:09:01-00:09:25 (25 sec)
No Signal (0.758)
But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation  [applause]: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:09:25-00:09:52 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.689)
We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to build a business  [applause]  to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth  [applause]; a future with affordable health care  [applause]  affordable childcare, paid leave. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:09:52-00:10:09 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.966)
And all of this is to say: Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause] Because we here all know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:10:09-00:10:21 (11 sec)
Weak (1.21)
And to keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:10:21-00:10:38 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.285)
And, yes, it is true that by many indicators, our economy is the strongest in the world  [applause]  but while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. [Applause] You know it, and I know it. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:10:38-00:10:42 (3 sec)
No StressLens
And when we win this election, here's what we're going to do about it.
Kamala Harris
00:10:42-00:10:46 (5 sec)
No StressLens
On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:10:46-00:11:00 (14 sec)
Weak (1.365)
We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:11:00-00:11:09 (9 sec)
No StressLens
We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. [Applause]

And we will take on Big Pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:11:31-00:11:55 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.018)
Our plan will lower costs and save many middle-class families thousands of dollars a year. But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind, one that would raise prices on middle-class families. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:11:55-00:11:56 (2 sec)
No StressLens
I take it you've seen it. [Laughter]
Kamala Harris
00:11:56-00:12:08 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.331)
Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class, be clear. And Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. [Audience boos]

Georgia, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not  [Audience calls out "Going back"]

No StressLens
Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote  [applause]; the freedom to be safe from gun violence  [applause]; the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate  [applause]; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride  [applause]; the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history  [applause]; and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body  [applause]  and not have her government tell her what to do. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:14:29-00:14:43 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.557)
Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. And I don't have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands  [applause]  each and every one of us.
Kamala Harris
00:14:43-00:15:03 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.412)
And we love our country. We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. [Applause]

00:18:40-00:19:31 (51 sec)
No StressLens
Well, Donald  [applause]  I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage  [applause]  because, as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face. [Laughs; Applause; Audience chants "Coach"]
