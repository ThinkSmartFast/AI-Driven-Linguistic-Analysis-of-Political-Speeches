No Signal (0.346)
Isn't it good to have a candidate who can pronounce the name correctly, so -- [laughter and applause]. Wow.
Tim Walz
00:00:19-00:00:31 (12 sec)
Weak (1.39)
Les, thank you. Thank you for the introduction. More importantly, thank you for articulating what we know it means to live out here in the Midwest: Care for your neighbors, kindness. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:00:31-00:00:35 (4 sec)

I want to acknowledge a few people today.
Tim Walz
00:00:35-00:00:43 (7 sec)
Medium (1.583)
Somebody who I have to tell you might be the kindest human being I have ever met: your governor, Tony Evers. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:00:43-00:01:00 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.101)
A dear friend of mine who I had a chance to serve with in the House of Representatives, an incredible senator: Tammy Baldwin. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:01:00-00:01:06 (6 sec)
No StressLens
The people's lawyer, your attorney general: Josh Kaul. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:01:06-00:01:13 (7 sec)
No StressLens
And someone who knows education is a foundation of everything: State Superintendent Jill Underly. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:01:13-00:01:48 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.342)
All the state and local officials are here, but I want to say -- a point of personal privilege on this -- I got a bunch of my family down here in the front, so -- [laughs]. [Applause] A coup- -- [applause] -- a couple of them -- a couple of them are Badgers too, by the way, so -- [applause].
Tim Walz
00:01:48-00:02:04 (16 sec)
Medium (1.919)
And a real special thank you to everybody here. Looking out across here, look, you're busy people. You got things to do. It's a summer day. You had to walk two miles. I had nothing to do with that, by the way -- [laughter] -- nothing, so --
Tim Walz
00:02:04-00:02:11 (6 sec)
Medium (1.881)
But you came here for one beautiful, simple reason: You love this country and this democracy. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:02:11-00:02:31 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.945)
I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket to help make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:02:31-00:02:48 (17 sec)
Medium (1.821)
You know it: Vice President Harris is on the side of the American people. She took on predators, fraudsters, transnational gang members. She stood up against powerful corporate interests. And she never hesitated, not once, to reach across the aisle if it improved people's lives. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:02:48-00:03:06 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.817)
Being a Midwesterner too, I know a little something about commitment to people. I was born in a small town in Nebraska, where community meant everything. My mom and dad taught me to show generosity to my neighbors and work for a common good.
Tim Walz
00:03:06-00:03:37 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.342)
At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. [Applause] For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation. [Applause] And -- and that service, just as it did for my dad, a Korean War-era veteran, and millions of others, I got the G.I. Bill, and it gave me a shot at a college education. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:03:37-00:03:57 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.703)
My dad was a teacher. My siblings were all teachers. [Applause] And three of them married teachers. [Applause] It's noble work. I had the privilege of teaching public school social studies and coaching football for 20 years. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:03:57-00:04:09 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.409)
And for all you Packer and Badgers fan, yeah, we did win a state championship, so -- [laughter and applause]. It's what we do.
Tim Walz
00:04:09-00:04:27 (18 sec)
Medium (1.735)
But it was my students who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought that much about it, but they saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: this idea of a commitment to a better world, a common good, a belief that one single person can actually make a difference. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:04:27-00:04:53 (26 sec)
No Signal (0.056)
I lived in a red district, but my neighbors were kind enough and graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States House of Representatives for 12 years to represent them. [Applause] I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:04:53-00:05:04 (11 sec)
No StressLens
And as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I brought all that experience -- [applause] --
Tim Walz
00:05:04-00:05:16 (12 sec)
No StressLens
Okay, okay. Are there Minnesotans in the house today? [Applause; Audience chants "Tim"]
Tim Walz
00:05:16-00:05:21 (5 sec)
Weak (1.324)
-- bringing that experience to tackling the challenges that were facing our state. We don't shy away from challenges.
Tim Walz
00:05:21-00:05:29 (8 sec)
No Signal (0.157)
But I'll tell you what, Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently than we see it. [Audience boos]
Tim Walz
00:05:29-00:06:05 (36 sec)
Weak (1.018)
He has no understanding of service because he's too busy servicing himself -- [laughter] -- again and again and again. Again and again and again, this guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division amongst the people, and that's to say nothing of the job he did as president. [Audience boos]
Tim Walz
00:06:05-00:06:10 (5 sec)
No StressLens
He froze in the face of COVID, and it cost people's lives. [Audience responds affirmatively]
Tim Walz
00:06:10-00:06:13 (3 sec)
No StressLens
He drove the economy into the ground. [Audience responds affirmatively]
Tim Walz
00:06:13-00:06:21 (7 sec)
No Signal (0.091)
And make no mistake about it, violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:06:21-00:06:36 (16 sec)
Weak (1.005)
Those of you who are a little older know this. Older Republicans used to talk about freedom. These guys today, it turns out that freedom to them means government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. [Audience boos]
Tim Walz
00:06:36-00:07:08 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.195)
Now, look, we're pretty neighborly with Wisconsin. We get our friendly battles. But in Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make -- [applause] -- even if -- even if we wouldn't make the same choices for ourselves, because we know there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:07:08-00:07:16 (7 sec)
No Signal (0.738)
I don't need you telling me about our health care, I don't need you telling us who we love, and I sure the hell don't need you telling us what books we're going to read. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:07:16-00:07:49 (33 sec)
No Signal (0.629)
And there's a very personal one for me, and that includes IVF. Some of you might have heard this. This is very personal for my wife and I. When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments. And I remember each night praying that the call was going to come, and it was going to be good news. The phone would ring, tenseness in my stomach, and then the agony when you heard the treatments hadn't worked.
Tim Walz
00:07:49-00:07:56 (7 sec)
Strong (2.051)
3 of 95 paragraphs scored.
So, it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our beautiful daughter, we named her Hope. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:07:56-00:08:29 (33 sec)
Weak (1.049)
When Vice President Harris and I and everyone here talks about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions -- [applause] -- and for all of our little ones to be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:08:29-00:08:38 (9 sec)
Weak (1.174)
And just like Wisconsin, over in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:08:38-00:08:53 (15 sec)
No Signal (0.735)
And just so you know, when I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the trap shoot three years in a [DEL: ray :DEL; row]. I can outshoot them too. [Applause] I can outshoot these guys.

Take care of one another on this. This is -- this is why we gather. Look, it's hot. It is hot. I'll come again. They've got folks here. We'll -- we'll make sure it -- we're okay.
Tim Walz
00:10:14-00:10:49 (35 sec)
No Signal (0.61)
But I -- I have to tell you all again, I -- in all seriousness, to come and gather like this to talk about our freedoms, the ability to talk about what could be good -- and I have to say, this idea of caring for our neighbor in kindness and a hand up when somebody needs it or just the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that's who we are. It's not about mocking. It's not name-callings and -- you see it amongst them. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:10:49-00:10:55 (7 sec)
No StressLens
[Claps] Yay! Thank you all. [Applause]

Thank you all. We're e- -- we're okay. He's going to -- we have someone down. They're treating him, they're getting him some water, and it's good. He's going to get up.
Tim Walz

You guys need some water too? We'll ask them.
Tim Walz

Teddy, can you see if they have some more water? That'd be great. Take care of your neighbors.

There we go. [Applause] There we go. There we go.

Weak (1.22)
All right. All right, folks. Hey, they're getting him taken care of. I -- we'll stay -- I don't want to be too lighthearted. I thought about doing the Minnesota Rouser, but I thought that might be too much over here on you. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:12:08-00:12:11 (3 sec)
No StressLens
Look, we'll get -- we'll get him taken care of.
Tim Walz
00:12:11-00:12:20 (9 sec)
Medium (1.704)
You know what this is about. This is about when they talk about the freedoms that we heard, and freedom in education means that our teachers aren't saddled with crippling debt when they go into this -- the student loan debt. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:12:20-00:12:29 (9 sec)
No Signal (0.953)
And I'll tell you what a big part of this is: We settle our political differences not through violence but through our votes. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:12:29-00:12:40 (10 sec)
No Signal (0.198)
The question is pretty simple. This election is all about asking that question. Which direction will this country go in?
Tim Walz
00:12:40-00:13:01 (22 sec)
Weak (1.411)
Donald Trump knows the direction he wants to take us. He wants to take it back. He wants to do the things that you saw. But be very clear. Don't believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do in restricting and taking our freedoms. He knows that it rigs the economy for the super rich.
Tim Walz
00:13:01-00:13:30 (29 sec)
Medium (1.574)
If he gets a chance to go back to the White House, it will be far worse than it was four years ago -- [applause] -- raising costs for the middle class; refeating -- repealing the Affordable Care Act; gutting Social Security and Medicare, the very safety nets that protect people when they're down; and, of course, banning abortions across this country with or without Congress. [Audience boos]
Tim Walz
00:13:30-00:13:36 (6 sec)
Strong (2.212)

This is where we talk to our neighbors. Donald Trump is not for you or your family.
Tim Walz
00:13:36-00:13:55 (20 sec)
Weak (1.043)
And Trump's running mate shares those same dangerous and backward beliefs. You know, just like all of us in regular America, we -- we go to Yale and then we have our careers funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then you write a book about the place you grew up and you trash that place. [Audience boos]
Tim Walz
00:13:55-00:14:12 (17 sec)
No Signal (0.35)
Come on. That's not who Wisconsin is. That's not who Minnesota is. We're better than that. We're better than that. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:14:12-00:14:16 (4 sec)
Medium (1.583)
One of the best parts of this job is going to be -- I can't wait until the debate, so -- [laughs]. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:14:16-00:14:44 (28 sec)
No Signal (0.536)
Look, I -- I've done this enough and I know bullies. And I'm not a name-caller, but what I am is a teacher; I observe things. So, I want to tell you: What I observed and you've deserved about -- observed about these guys when you see them, that it's a very clear thing. Yes, they are creepy and -- and weird as hell. [Applause] You see it. You see it.
Tim Walz
00:14:44-00:14:49 (5 sec)

This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Nobody is asking for this crazy stuff.
Tim Walz
00:14:49-00:15:09 (20 sec)
No Signal (0.059)
So, I'll tell you what. You heard it from the vice president; you've heard her talk about this. We're sure the hell not going back. We're not going back. [Applause] We are not going back. [Audience responds "We're not going back"]
Tim Walz

Tim Walz
00:15:14-00:15:27 (13 sec)
Medium (1.584)
We damn sure aren't, but it's even more than that. This is a campaign about where we're going, and that's a future where everyone matters and everyone is included. [Applause]
Tim Walz
00:15:27-00:15:37 (10 sec)
Weak (1.205)
Kamala Harris, she believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes in opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. And she believes in the promise of America. [Applause]

I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski -- [applause]; chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wikler -- [applause]; and my dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin.

And in November, we are going to re-elect her to the United States Senate. [Applause]

And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is Dad. To his fedel- -- fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. [Applause] To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was a congressman. [Applause] To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz.

And I've been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before. And many of you know, then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. [Applause] And before that -- and before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:22:37-00:23:14 (37 sec)
No Signal (0.17)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type. [Applause; Laughs] I know his type.
Kamala Harris

In fact, I've been dealing with people like him my whole career. [Applause] For example, as attorney general of California -- [Audience members call out, inaudibly]

Weak (1.258)
So, I'll tell you, as attorney general, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. [Audience boos]

So, in this campaign, I'll tell you: I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- [applause] -- any day of the week.
Kamala Harris
00:24:35-00:24:57 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.569)
But let's make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It's about two very different visions for our nation -- two very different visions: one, for us, focused on the future; the other focused on the past.
Kamala Harris
00:24:57-00:25:18 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.606)
And, Wisconsin, we -- we here -- we fight for the future. [Applause] We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union -- [applause]; where -- [Audience chants "Union strong"]
Kamala Harris
00:25:18-00:25:19 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Union strong. [Audience chants "Union strong"]
Kamala Harris
00:25:19-00:25:51 (32 sec)
No Signal (0.033)
We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity -- [applause]; a future where we build a broad-based economy and one where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:25:51-00:26:13 (22 sec)
Weak (1.115)
And understand, in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors -- [applause] -- joyful warriors. Because we know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:26:13-00:26:56 (42 sec)
No StressLens
And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. [Applause] We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America's families so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead -- [applause] -- because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
Kamala Harris
00:26:56-00:27:48 (52 sec)
No StressLens
You know, when I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be a day-one priority to fight to bring down prices. [Applause] I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans -- [applause] -- and continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America -- [applause] -- and back to communities like Eau Claire. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:27:48-00:28:19 (30 sec)
No Signal (0.793)
So, all this is to say: Strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause] Because, you see, Coach Walz and I know when America's middle class is strong, America is strong. And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:28:19-00:28:31 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.727)
There is so much evidence of that point. There really is. But look at, most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:28:31-00:28:45 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.397)
Project 2025 -- you know, if you have some time to take a look at it, I'm telling you, it -- it is a plan to weaken the middle class. It is a plan to weaken the middle class.
Kamala Harris
00:28:45-00:28:55 (10 sec)
No Signal (0.105)
If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:28:55-00:29:00 (5 sec)
No StressLens
He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:29:00-00:29:11 (10 sec)
No Signal (0.422)
He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis, and he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. [Audience responds "No"]
Kamala Harris
00:29:11-00:29:27 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.734)
And because we all remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means. That's about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember that -- [Audience member calls out "We're not going back"]
Kamala Harris
00:29:27-00:29:38 (11 sec)
No StressLens
-- what that was like when -- we're not going back. We're not going back. [Audience responds "We're not going back"]
Kamala Harris
00:29:38-00:29:40 (2 sec)
No StressLens
We are not going back. [Audience chants "We're not going back"]
Kamala Harris
00:29:40-00:29:43 (3 sec)
No StressLens
We are not going back.
Kamala Harris
00:29:43-00:29:51 (9 sec)
No Signal (0.875)
But in order to know where we need to go, let's remember the past and what that was like, because we cannot forget.
Kamala Harris
00:29:51-00:30:12 (21 sec)
No Signal (0.067)
On that point about the ACA, remember people with pre-existing conditions being denied -- children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes? That was no joke. And we cannot go back. Ours has to be a fight for the future and a fight for freedom -- [applause] -- a fight for freedom.
Kamala Harris
00:30:12-00:30:56 (44 sec)
No StressLens
Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water -- [applause]; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride -- [applause]; and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:30:56-00:31:18 (22 sec)
Weak (1.086)
And let's remember -- let's remember the traditions of our great country. Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now, then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us.
Kamala Harris
00:31:18-00:31:34 (15 sec)
No Signal (0.815)
So, we, then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:31:34-00:31:48 (14 sec)
No Signal (0.134)
We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:31:48-00:32:15 (27 sec)
No Signal (0.44)
We who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman's right to choose. [Applause] And we remember that when he was president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court -- the court of Thurgood and RBG -- because he intended for them to overturn Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:32:15-00:32:27 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.673)
And now more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:32:27-00:32:39 (12 sec)
No Signal (0.646)
And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin. [Audience responds "No"]
Kamala Harris
00:32:39-00:32:46 (7 sec)
No StressLens
But we are not going to let that happen. [Audience responds "No"]
Kamala Harris
00:32:46-00:32:48 (2 sec)
No StressLens
Because we trust women. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:32:48-00:33:01 (13 sec)
Strong (2.226)
1 of 95 paragraphs scored.
And when I am president of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, I will sign it into law. [Applause; Audience chants "Coach"]
Kamala Harris
00:33:01-00:33:09 (8 sec)
No StressLens
Thank you all.
Kamala Harris
00:33:09-00:33:43 (34 sec)
No Signal (0.74)
So, listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community. [Applause] And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election. It can't be said seriously enough. So much is on the line.
Kamala Harris
00:33:43-00:34:10 (27 sec)
Weak (1.098)
And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that, going forward, he will be immune no matter what he does in the White House. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:34:10-00:34:23 (13 sec)
No Signal (0.611)
Think about what that means and the changed circumstances since 16-6-20 when you think about what that court decision means. Donald Trump has openly vowed, if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one -- [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:34:23-00:34:29 (6 sec)
No StressLens
-- that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies -- [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:34:29-00:34:34 (5 sec)
No StressLens
-- that he would round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country -- [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:34:34-00:34:40 (5 sec)
No StressLens
-- and even, quote, terminate the United States Constitution. [Audience boos]
Kamala Harris
00:34:40-00:35:14 (34 sec)
No Signal (0.196)
So, let us be clear. Let us be clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:35:14-00:35:36 (23 sec)
No Signal (0.171)
So, basically, I think it all comes down to this. We're all here because we love our country. We love our country. [Applause] We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.
Kamala Harris
00:35:36-00:36:15 (38 sec)
No Signal (0.86)
And that's how we preserve the promise of America, because, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today. Just think about it: two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother -- [applause] -- and had a summer job at McDonald's -- [applause]; the other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:36:15-00:36:44 (29 sec)
No Signal (0.289)
Think about that. Only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way, together, to the White House. [Applause] Only in America. Only in America. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:36:44-00:37:15 (31 sec)
No Signal (0.637)
So, this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every person in our nation. And, also, I'll tell you -- and I promise you, our campaign is going to reach out to everyone -- from red states, from blue states, from the heartland to the coast. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. [Applause] And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:37:15-00:37:32 (18 sec)
No Signal (0.949)
Because Coach Walz and I know -- and we're clear about this, unlike the other side -- we work for you. [Applause] We work for you, the American people, and we will always fight for you -- for your family, for your freedoms, and for your future.
Kamala Harris
00:37:32-00:37:54 (21 sec)
Weak (1.012)
So, Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that we each face. We each face a question in this election, and that is: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law -- [Audience responds affirmatively]
Kamala Harris
00:37:54-00:37:59 (6 sec)

-- or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? [Audience responds "No"]
Kamala Harris
00:37:59-00:38:12 (13 sec)
No Signal (0.91)
And the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power -- individually and collectively, we each have the power in a democracy to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:38:12-00:38:36 (24 sec)
Weak (1.024)
So, in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. [Applause] We need you to knock on doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize and organize and mobilize and make your voices heard. [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:38:36-00:39:13 (37 sec)
No Signal (0.196)
And I'll tell you, about an hour ago, after I landed on Air Force Two, I -- I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop 3307. Oh, they were spectacular. Oh, they were spectacular. None of them high- -- taller than three feet. They -- [laughter] -- I mean, just they were spectacular.
Kamala Harris
00:39:13-00:39:29 (16 sec)
No Signal (0.613)
And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, "You are powerful, and your voice matters." [Applause] Right? From the mouths of babes, they're telling us. They're telling us.
Kamala Harris
00:39:29-00:39:38 (9 sec)

And so, let's remember that. Let's remember our power. Let's remember our voice matters.
Kamala Harris
00:39:38-00:39:51 (13 sec)
No StressLens
And with that, then, I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard? [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:39:51-00:39:53 (1 sec)
No StressLens
Do we believe in freedom? [Applause]
Kamala Harris

Do we believe in opportunity? [Applause]

Do we believe in the promise of America? [Applause]
Kamala Harris

And are we ready to fight for it? [Applause]
Kamala Harris
00:39:57-00:40:00 (3 sec)

And when we fight -- [Audience responds "We win"]
Kamala Harris
