Wow. [Audience chants "USA"] Well, thank you very much. This -- this is quite a gathering, isn't it? This is it, we're getting to the end. We're getting to the end. And we're leading in all the polls, so that's a good thing. We better keep it going. Like your wrestling team, we better keep it going, you know.

A very big hello to Pennsylvania. Thank you very much. This is some little gathering we have. We really give a very special hello to Penn State. We love Penn State. We love Penn State. I'm thrilled to be here, the home of the Nittany Lions with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. You're very special.

I think I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question, are you better off now than you were four years ago? [Audience responds "No"] So, I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans. If you want to go out and win an election -- do you want to win an election? Because we are leading, but we got to close it out, right? We got to close it out.

I will promise you we're going to end inflation very quickly. We're going to get those prices down, too. I'll stop the invasion of criminals pouring into our country. They're criminals and they're pouring in like we've never seen. We're going to stop it. We're going to get them the hell out of here. And I will bring back the American dream because you want the American dream and we're going to bring it back.

So, this is all you really need to know: Kamala broke it, and I will fix it. We're going to fix it very fast. We're going to fix our country up very fast. With your support on November 5th, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. We're going to do it fast.

This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, it's disgusting what they're doing, or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. I'm asking you to be excited about the future. You want to be excited about the future.

People aren't excited about this country very much anymore with the people we have in there. We have the worst president in the history of our country. We have the worst vice president, a grossly incompetent person in the history of our country. I'm asking you to dream big again. You're going to dream big just like your wrestling team dreams big.

Where the hell are they? Where are they? I hear that team is brutal out there, I can tell. It's easy to tell, I can pick every one of them off. Jim Jordan told me about you guys. You know, Jim Jordan, he told me about -- look at them over there, muscles all over the place. You better get ready because they're going to bring you up here in a little while.

So, you guys better get ready. You guys better get ready. Maybe I'll wrestle one of them or two of them, huh? That would be an upset. No, no, I'm not -- I'm not going to play that game. Anyway, you get ready, we're bringing you up here in a little while, OK? So tone up those muscles a little bit. Congratulations fellas, that's fantastic.

Man, that's a fantastic record you have. This will be America's new golden age, and every problem facing us can be solved. But now, the fate of our nation is in your hands. And it really is.

It's gone bad, it's so sad. When you look at the things we're doing that we even have to say like men playing in women's sports. I don't think so. [Audience boos] I don't think so. No, but you think of it, so many things, all the transgender operations, all the -- coming into our country, they're letting criminals into our country by the millions.

Pennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that -- I can't even believe I'm saying the name Kamala, nobody ever heard of her. I'm running against somebody -- and you can't use the name Harris. If I say Harris, Harris, they say, "Who the hell is Harris?" Did you see when she got stuck two weeks ago in the teleprompter? It was 32 days, now there's nine days left.
Donald Trump
00:04:53-00:05:23 (30 sec)
Weak (1.406)
But it was 32 days, and she's reading and the teleprompter broke. That happens a lot. If you're going to be a politician, you better be able to get through it without a teleprompter, but she can't. And the sucker snapped back, damn it, it snapped back. She was reading, right? She goes, "And 32 days -- 32 days -- 32 days, 32 --" I said, "Oh, this is bad."

And then, boom, it snapped back. Too bad. But Pennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough, you're not going to take it anymore. "You're the worst vice president. You destroyed San Francisco. You are horrible to the great state of California. You're just horrible. Kamala, you're fired. Get out of here, Kamala. Get the hell out of here. We've had enough of this crap."

Can you imagine going through -- we just went through four years with a guy that had no clue. And now, we're supposed to go through another one. And she's worse than him. She's worse. The polls are open for early voting here in Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania. We didn't have quite as good a wrestling team, I will admit.

They were OK. I would say they would have lost like -- they would have lost -- most of them would be -- I think every one of them pinned in the first minute or less.

But we're setting all-time records right now in the voting. I don't know if you heard that, you know, the fake news. It's like, Oh, look at all of the fake news.

We've got to keep it going. We're doing incredibly. Nobody's done like we're doing right now. I know you like me, but I know you're also comparing it to what we had for four years, so that's what's happening with the vote. [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump."] I think we're going to keep it going, and we're going to have a real landslide-type election and that's what we have to have.

But everybody has to go out and vote. Just out of curiosity, who has already voted? [Audience responds affirmatively] OK, that's good, because with that number, and then we're about to go and do the real thing, right? Who is going to vote? [Audience responds affirmatively] That's good. That's great. Well, thanks for the early voters, but the Republicans tend to vote late.

They like Tuesdays, and that's fine. Just get out and vote. Everybody promise you're going to vote, right? Promise? [Audience responds affirmatively] OK. If you're a student here at Penn State, and it really is -- it's a great place, I've known it for a long time. I know so many people that have graduated and done so well here, you can vote in person, you can vote by mail.

Then, get your friends, call your parents, call your grandparents, your cousins, call anybody. A woman named Jane, I know her very well, she said to her husband, he is a big slob of a guy, big fat slob, and he said -- and she said to him, "Harold, get the hell out of that sofa.

But I'm watching the game. "Get your ass out of the sofa." And he got up and he voted. He feels good about himself now. And he sat back down, and he watched the game. But get everyone to swamp the vote. We want to swamp them. We want to make it too big to rig because, you know, bad things happen with these guys.

We've got to make it too big. The one thing you do, you make it too big, they can't do a thing. So, let's get out. Everybody has to get out. And we want to have a big margin. We want to have a big, fat, beautiful margin. With your help 10 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania, we're going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again.

We've all had a lot of victories. We've had the best rallies ever. There's never been -- outside, you have as many people as this standing out there. If anybody would like to give up their seat or their location, I'm sure that you'd have it filled very quickly if you'd like to do that. I don't think too many people are going to do that.

But we've had great success. You know, sort of, in one way, it's beautiful and another way it's a little sad because we've had these rallies. And we have nine days to go to total victory, and then we're going to have a different kind of a victory. We're going to turn our nation around. We're going to have control of a situation that needs having control of.

And we're going to turn it around. It's going to happen really fast, too. Two things, first day, first hour, we can do many things in the first -- but first, we're going to drill, baby, drill. [Audience responds affirmatively] And we're going to close our borders to criminals and drug dealers and all of these people coming in from mental institutions and asylums.

We are going to have those borders closed. They asked me, "What would you do?" I listed about six things. They asked her, "What would you do different?" Did you see her answer?

I think I'd leave everything the same. That's the end of that election. When she said that, I said, "That's got to be the greatest ad ever." Right, Marjorie?

Did you ever hear of Al Capone? The guy's -- you think this has been fun? But, you know, we had four of the greatest years. We have -- we had the greatest economy in the history of our country.

You got to do this. Yes. Without that chart, I wouldn't be here. I turned around and said, "Bring down the chart." I wouldn't be -- I wouldn't be here, I guess, probably. But see, the arrow on the bottom, that's the lowest in history. This was done by the Border Patrol, and that was my last day in office.

And then these incompetent people took over. What they've done to our country, it's unbelievable. Look at what happened. It's all illegal immigration, criminals pouring into our country at levels that we've never seen before, drugs pouring into our country 10 times more than we had seen ever. The country is just -- it's in free fall.

We're a nation in decline, and we're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around fast. But even beyond that, even if it didn't show those great numbers, I love that chart.

That was the lowest -- single lowest time, and then they came in and it just -- all they had to do was leave it. We had Remain in Mexico. How about that? Do you think that was easy to get?

We're going to make America great again. It's true. That's true. You know, we did so well the second time, but then I sat back and I watched. And I thought we did a good job, we did a great job as president. We built our military, got the biggest tax cuts ever. We had the biggest regulation cuts, which actually were probably even more meaningful than the tax cuts.

We had the best job numbers. It was great. We rebuilt our military. I sat back, and I assumed that these people would do OK or good. They were so bad. I watched -- I couldn't believe it, and I said, "I got to do it again. I got to do it again." Because we had the country at a point -- in fact, I was going to have a theme, not make America great -- it was keep America great, KAG.

But MAG is much better than KAG. True, KAG, keep America great. The problem was America became not great, and so we couldn't do that. And then I said, "We have to run because these people have no idea what the hell they're doing." And now, we're running and we're leading and we have to finish it off.

And then, we're going to turn it around even better than before. We're going to make it stronger and better. So, many people come up to me at all these places -- we just had a big one in Detroit.

You watch, it's come back fast. But the reason I've gone through all of these battles and endured all of the abuse I have certainly have in, you know, history -- Andrew Jackson was considered the president who was really probably hit the hardest, and then Abraham Lincoln.

She stood over the french fries. That's what I was doing, making french fries. I'll tell you, those things are damn good when you get them before they get cold. And I stood over the french fries because I wanted -- so I went -- I was there for about 15 minutes, which meant I was there for 15 minutes longer than her because she never worked at McDonald's.

We won two world wars. And let me tell you, we're not woke. These guys aren't woke. A couple of the stupid people we have at the top. Guys like Milley -- General Milley and Mattis.

The fact that we were even thinking about anybody, everybody was peaceful with us because they know how good our military is.

In conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala, and we are going to save America. With your support, we will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American.

I'm going to put in legislation immediately upon getting to Washington that makes it an absolute penalty to burn our American flag. One year in prison, one year. If you want to burn our American flag, you go to prison for one year. I looked at what happened two months ago in Washington, DC, with the horrible scene.

They were burning flags all over the place and spraying -- spray paint on beautiful limestone, beautiful limestone, but that's my business. You know, real estate.
